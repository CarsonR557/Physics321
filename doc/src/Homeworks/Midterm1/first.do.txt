===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. 

=== Introduction to the first midterm project, total score 100 (pt) ===

The relevant reading background is
o chapters 2-5 of Taylor.
o chapters 6-14 of Malthe-Sørenssen.

In this midterm project we will start with a potential similar to the
one we discussed in exercise 4 in homework 6. There are some elements
of that exercise which are repeated here, similarly, a good fraction
of the codes you have developed for homeworks 4-6 can be used here.
We start with a one-dimensional potential and motion.  Thereafter we
extend this potential model to a two-dimensional model and study the
numerical solution of the corresponding problem.

=== Part 1, Particle in a one-dimensional  potential ===

We consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a one-dimensional potential,
!bt
\[
V(x)=\frac{V_0}{d^4}\left(x^4-2x^2d^2+d^4\right).
\]
!et
We will assume all other forces on the particle are small in comparison, and neglect them in our model.  The parameters $V_0$ and $d$ are known constants. 

o (5pt) Plot the potential and find the  equilibrium points (stable and unstable) by requiring that the first derivative of the potential is zero. Make an energy diagram (see for example Malthe-Sørenssen chapter 11.3) and mark the equilibrium points on the diagram and characterize their stability. The position of the particle is $x$. 

o (5pt) Choose two different energies that give two distinct types of motions, draw them into the energy diagram, and describe the motion in each case.


o (5pt) If the particle  starts at rest at $x=2d$, what is the velocity of the atom at the point $x=d$?

o (5pt) If the particle  starts at rest at $x=d$ with velocity $v_0$, how large must $v_0$ be for the  particle to reach the point $x=−d$?


o (5pt) Use the above potential to set up the total forces acting on the particle.  Find the acceleration acting on the particle. Is this a conservative force? Calculate also the _curl_ of the force  $\bm{\nabla}\times \bm{F}$ in order to validate your conclusion. 

o (5pt) Are linear momentum and angular momentum conserved? 

o g (5pt) Write a numerical algorithm to find the position and velocity of the particle at a time $t+\Delta t$ given the position and velocity at a time $t$. Here we aim at the _Euler-Cromer and the Velocity Verlet algorithms_.   

o (10pt) Implement the numerical algorithms in a program to find the position of the particle as function of time from $t=0$ to $t=30$ s using a mass  $m=1.0$ kg, the parameter $V_0=1$ J and $d=0.1$ m. Make a plot of two distinct positions with initial conditions $x_0=d$ and $v_0=0.5$ m/s, $x_0=d$ and $v_0=1.5$ m/s, and $x_0=d$ and $v_0=2.5$ m/s. Plot also the velocity.  Perform calculations with and without the term $x^4$ in the potential. Do you see a difference? Compare and discuss the results obtained with the Velocity Verlet algorithm and the Euler-Cromer algorithm. 

o (5pt) Describe the behavior of the particle for the three initial conditions  and sketch the motion in an energy diagram. Is energy conserved in your simulations?

o (5pt) Repeat the calculations with the full potential and all three initial conditions but now with a damping force $-\beta v$. Find the modified acceleration using $\beta/m=0.1$. Discuss your results and sketch again the motion in an energy diagram.

=== Part 2, two dimensions ===


We move then to two dimensions. Our particle/object interacts with a surface potential given by
!bt
\[
V(r)=\frac{V_0}{d^4}\left(r^4-2r^2d^2+d^4\right),
\]
!et
where $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is the distance to the origin.

o (5pt) Show that the acceleration is now $\bm{a}=-\frac{4V_0}{md^4}\left(r^3-rd^2\right)\frac{\bm{r}}{r}$.

o (10pt) Rewrite your program to find the velocity and position of the atom using the new expression for the force $\bm{F}$. Use vectorized expressions in your code as you did in homework 4 for the Earth-Sun system. See eventually the code from the "lectures":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/energyconserv/html/energyconserv.html".  We recommend to revisit the Earth-Sun problem from homework 4 since it has several similarities with the problem here.

o (10pt) Plot the motion of a particle starting in $\bm{r}_0=(d,0)$ from $t=0$ s to $t=20$ s for the initial velocities $\bm{v}_0=(0,0.5)$ m/s, $\bm{v}_0=(0,1)$ m/s, and $\bm{v}_0=(0,1.5)$ m/s. The parameters $d$ and $V_0$ are as before.

o (10pt) Is energy conserved? 

o (10pt) Can you choose initial conditions $r_0$ and $v_0$ in such a manner that the particle moves in a circular orbit with a constant radius? If so, what initial conditions are those? Plot the motion for these conditions.
