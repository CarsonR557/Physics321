TITLE: PHY321: Classical Mechanics 1
AUTHOR: Second midterm project, due Friday April 17
DATE: today

===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o How do I(we)  hand in?  Due to the extraordinary situation we are in now, the midterm should be handed in fully via D2L. You can scan your handwritten notes and upload to D2L or you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook.

=== Introduction to the second midterm project, total score 100 points ===

The relevant reading background is
o chapter 8 of  Taylor.
o Lecture notes on central forces and two-body problems
o Homeworks 4, 7, 8 and 9


=== Part 1, a paper and pencil exercise with another type of potential ===

=== Part 2, making a program for the solar system ===

=== Part 3, Bonus part (30pt), testing conservation of angular momentum  ===
