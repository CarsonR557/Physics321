===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o Homeworks are available Wednesday/Thursday the week before the deadline. The deadline is at the Friday lecture.
o How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. 

=== Introduction to homework 5 ===

This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational
exercises are a continuation of the topics from the previous homework set. We keep dealing with simple motion problems and conservation laws; energy, momentum and angular momentum. These conservation laws are central in Physics and understanding them properly lays the foundation for understanding and analyzing more complicated physics problems.
The relevant reading background is
o chapters 3 and 4 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and
o chapters 10-14 of Malthe-Sørenssen.
In both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. Malthe-Sørenssen's text contains also several coding examples you may find useful. 

The numerical homework focuses on another motion problem where you can
use the code you developed in homework 4, almost entirely. Please take
a look at the posted solution (jupyter-notebook) for homework 4. You
need only to change the forces at play. The problem at hand is again a
classic one, a block fastened to a spring moving back and forth along the $x$-axis. It is a simpler problem compared to the previous homework. It allows us however to introduce damping (friction) and study more realistic situations. 



=== Exercise 1 (15 pt), Work-energy theorem and conservation laws ===

This exercise was partly discussed during the lectures. It has not yet been edited in the online notes.
We will study a classical electron which moves in the $x$-direction along a surface. The force from the surface is
!bt
\[
\bm{F}(x)=-F_0\sin{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}\bm{e}_x.
\]
!et
The constant $b$ represents the distance between atoms at the surface of the material, $F_0$ is a constant and $x$ is the position of the electron.

* 1a (2pt) Is this a conservative force? And if so, what does that imply?
This is indeed a conservative force since it depends only on position and its _curl_ is zero. This means that energy is conserved and the integral over the work done by the force is independent of the path taken. 
* 1b (4pt) Use the work-energy theorem to find the velocity $v(x)$. 

Using the work-energy theorem we can find the work $W$ done when moving an electron from a position $x_\
0$ to a final position $x$ through the integral
!bt
\[
W=-\int_{x_0}^x \bm{F}(x')dx' =  \int_{x_0}^x F_0\sin{(\frac{2\pi x'}{b})} dx',
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
W=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right].
\]
!et
Since this is related to the change in kinetic energy we have, with $v_0$ being the initial velocity at a  time $t_0$,
!bt
\[
v  = \pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right]+v_0^2}.
\]
!et
* 1c (4pt) With the above expression for the force, find the potential energy.
The potential energy, due to energy conservation is
!bt
\[
V(x)=V(x_0)+\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2-\frac{1}{2}mv^2,
\]
!et
with $v$ given by the previous answer. 
We can now, in order to find a more explicit expression for the potential energy at a given value $x$, define a zero level value for the potential. The potential is defined , using the work-energy theorem , as
!bt
\[
V(x)=V(x_0)+\int_{x_0}^x (-F(x'))dx',
\]
!et
and if you recall the definition of the indefinite integral, we can rewrite this as
!bt
\[
V(x)=\int (-F(x'))dx'+C,
\]
!et
where $C$ is an undefined constant. The force is defined as the gradient of the potential, and in that case the undefined constant vanishes. The constant does not affect the force we derive from the potential.

We have then
!bt
\[
V(x)=V(x_0)-\int_{x_0}^x \bm{F}(x')dx',
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
V(x)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right]+V(x_0).
\]
!et
We can now define
!bt
\[
\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}=V(x_0),
\]
!et
which gives 
!bt
\[
V(x)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}\right].
\]
!et

* 1d (5pt) Make a plot of the potential energy and discuss the equilibrium points where the force on the electron is zero. Discuss the physical interpretation of stable and unstable equilibrium points. Use energy conservation. 

The following Python code plots the potential
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from math import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Deltax = 0.01
#set up arrays
xinitial = -2.0
xfinal = 2.0 
n = ceil((xfinal-xinitial)/Deltax)
x = np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    x[i] = xinitial+i*Deltax
V = np.zeros(n)
# Setting values for the constants. 
F0 = 1.0; b = 1.0; 
# Defining the potential
V = F0*b/(2*pi)*np.cos(2*pi*x/b)
# Plot position as function of time    
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_ylabel('x')
ax.set_xlabel('V')
ax.plot(x, V)
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
!ec

We have stable equilibrium  points for every minimum of the $\cos$ function and unstable equilibrium points where it has its maximimum values. At the minimum the particle has the lowest potential energy and the largest kinetic energy whereas at the maxima it has the largest potential energy and lowest kinetic energy. 
=== Exsercise 2 (15pt), Rocket, Momentum and mass ===

Taylor exercise 3.11.    This exercise was partly discussed during the lectures, see the notes on "Energy and Momentum etc, see the part on Momentum conservation ":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/energyconserv/html/energyconserv.html". Taylor's chapter 3.2 covers also this example.

* 3.11 a and b

Consider the rocket of mass $M$ moving with velocity $v$. After a
brief instant, the velocity of the rocket is $v+\Delta v$ and the mass
is $M-\Delta M$. Momentum conservation gives


!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
Mv&=&(M-\Delta M)(v+\Delta v)+\Delta M(v-v_e)\\
0&=&-\Delta Mv+M\Delta v+\Delta M(v-v_e),\\
0&=&M\Delta v-\Delta Mv_e.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


In the second step we ignored the term $\Delta M\Delta v$ since we
assume it is small. The last equation gives


!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta v&=&\frac{v_e}{M}\Delta M,\\
\nonumber
\frac{dv}{dt}&=&\frac{v_e}{M}\frac{dM}{dt}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Integrating the expression with lower limits $v_0=0$ and $M_0$, one finds

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
v&=&v_e\int_{M_0}^M \frac{dM'}{M'}\\
v&=&-v_e\ln(M/M_0)\\
&=&-v_e\ln[(M_0-\alpha t)/M_0].
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
We have ignored gravity here. If we add gravity as the external force, we get when integrating an additional terms $-gt$, that is
!bt
\[
v=-v_e\ln[(M_0-\alpha t)/M_0]-gt.
\]
!et

* 3.11c
Inserting numbers $v_e=3000$ m/s, $M_0/M=2$ and $g=9.8$ m/s$^{2}$, we find $v=900$ m/s. With $g=0$ the corresponding number is $2100$ m/s, so gravity reduces the speed acquired in the first two minutes to a little less than half its weight-free value.

* 3.11d

If the thrust $\Delta Mv_e$ is less than the weight $mg$, the rocket will just sit on the ground until it has shed enough mass that the thrust can overcome the weight, definitely not a good design. 


===  Exercise 3 (10pt), More Rockets ===

Taylor exercises 3.13 (5pt) and 3.14 (5pt). This is a continuation of the previous exercise and most of the relevant background material can be found in Taylor chapter 3.2. 

Taking the velocity from the previous exercise and integrating over time we find the height
!bt
\[
y(t) = y(t_0=0)+\int_0^tv(t')dt',
\]
!et
which gives
!bt
\[
y(t) = v_et\ln{M_0}-v_e\int_0^t \ln{M(t')}dt'-\frac{1}{2}gt^2.
\]
!et
To do the integral over time we recall that $M(t')=M_0-\Delta M t'$. We assumed that $\Delta M=k$ is a constant. We obtain then that the integral gives
!bt
\[
\int_0^t \ln{M(t')}dt' = \frac{1}{k}\left(M_0\ln{M_0}-M\ln{M}\right)-t,
\]
!et
where we used that $M_0-M=kt$. We have assumed that mass decreases by a constant $k$ times time $t$.
Inserting into $y(t)$ we obtain then
!bt
\[
y(t) = v_et-\frac{1}{2}gt^2-\frac{mv_e}{k}\ln{(\frac{M_0}{M})}.
\]
!et
Using the numbers from the previous exercise with $t=2$ min we obtain that $y\approx 40$ km.

For exercise 3.14 (5pt) we have the equation of motion which reads $Ma=kv_e-bv$ or
!bt
\[
\frac{Mdv}{kv_e-bv}=dt.
\]
!et
We have that $dM/dt =-k$ (assumed a constant rate for mass change). We can then replace $dt$ by $-dM/k$ and we have
!bt
\[
\frac{kdv}{kv_e-bv}=-\frac{dM}{M}.
\]
!et
Integrating gives
!bt
\[
v = \frac{kv_e}{b}\left[1-(\frac{M}{M_0})^{b/k}\right].
\]
!et

=== Exercise 4 (10pt), Center of mass  ===

Taylor exercise 3.20. Here Taylor's chapter 3.3 can be of use. This relation will turn out to be very useful when we discuss systems of many classical particles.

The definition of the center of mass for $N$ objects can be written as
!bt
\[
M\bm{R}=\sum{i=1}^Nm_i\bm{r}_i,
\]
!et
where $m_i$ and $\bm{r}_i$ are the masses and positions of object $i$, respectively.

Assume now that we have a collection of $N_1$ objects with masses $m_{1i}$ and positions $\bm{r}_{1i}$
with $i=1,\dots,N_1$ and  a collection of $N_2$ objects with masses $m_{2j}$ and positions $\bm{r}_{2j}$
with $j=1,\dots,N_2$.

The total mass of the two-body system is $M=M_1+M_2=\sum{i=1}^{N_1}m_{1i}+\sum{j=1}^{N_2}m_{2j}$. The center of mass position $\bm{R}$ of the whole system satisfies then
!bt
\[
M\bm{R}=\sum{i=1}^{N_1}m_{1i}\bm{r}_{1i}+\sum{j=1}^{N_2}m_{2j}\bm{r}_{2j}=M_1\bm{R}_1+M_2\bm{R}_2,
\]
!et
where $\bm{R}_1$ and $\bm{R}_2$ are the the center of mass positions of the two separate bodies and the second equality follows from our rewritten definition of the center of mass applied to each body separately. This is the required result.

===  Exercise 5 (10pt), Sliding Block  and Spring (please not again), Scaling the Equations and getting started with numerical project ===
The relevant material with codes etc is covered by the "Lecture Notes on Oscillations":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/harmonic/html/harmonic.html". Taylor's chapter 5, in particular sections 5.1 amd 5.2. 5.4 is relevant for the bonus exercise.
We start now with our next numerical application with simple rewrites of our equations. The system we will look at is that of a block fastened to a spring (which in turn is tied to a wall).
The force acting on the block from the spring in the $x$-drection only is
!bt
\[
m\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}=F(x) = -k(x-b),
\]
!et
where $k$ is a material specific constant and $b$ is the equilibrium position. The block has mass $m$ and $t$ is time. Define the initial time as $t_0$. We will for simplicity set the equilibrium position to zero, that is $b=0$.

* 5a (3pt) Does this force conserve energy? If so, with given initial position and velocity $x_0$ and $v_0$, respectively, find the expression for energy conservation in terms of the potential and kinetic energies.  

* 5b (3pt) Define a constant $\omega_0=\sqrt{k/m}$ and show that you can write the acceleration as $a(t) = -\omega_0^2 x(t)$. What is the dimentionality of $\omega_0$? (it is normally called a natural frequency).  

* 5c (4pt) Introduce now a dimensionless time $\tau = t\omega_0$. Show that you can rewrite the  equation for the acceleration in terms of two first-order differential equations

!bt
\[
\frac{dv}{d\tau} = -x,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{dx}{d\tau} = v.
\]
!et
What are the dimensionalities of these two equations?

These are the equations which we will code in the next exercise.

===  Exercise 6 (40pt), Sliding Block  and Spring, now the code  ===


_This exercise should be handed in as a jupyter-notebook_ at D2L. Remember to write your name(s). 

Last week we:
o Studied  the Euler-Cromer and Velocity Verlet  to find the position and the velocity of  Earth orbiting around the sun.
o We added the Euler-Cromer and Velocity-Verlet methods to our toolbag for solving ordinary differential equations.
o We compared and analyzed the stability of the  computational solutions.

This week we will reuse our code from homework 4 and study a block
which slides back and forth without friction in the $x$-direction.
The only thing we need to is to change the forces at play and since we
limit motion only to the $x$-direction we can simplify our code to
only that degree of freedom.
The advantage with the block sliding back and forth is that we have analytical solutions for the velocity and the position. 


* 6a (20pt) Find the analytical solutions for the velocity and position as function of the initial conditions. 

* 6b (20 pt)  Write then a program which solves the above differential equations for the sliding blook using the Euler-Cromer  method and the velocity Verlet method. Study the results for the position, velocity and energy conservation as function of time and the step size in time. Compare the numerical results with the analytical ones. Check that your results for position and velocity obey periodicity. 
Is energy properly conserved? Discuss your results. 

Here follows a simple code example which could be used to study the sliding block.
!bc pycod
DeltaT = 0.001
#set up arrays 
tfinal = 10 # in seconds
n = ceil(tfinal/DeltaT)
# set up arrays for time t, velocity v, and position r
t = np.zeros(n)
v = np.zeros(n)
x = np.zeros(n)
# Example of Initial conditions
x0 = 1.0
v0 = 0.0
r[0] = r0
v[0] = v0
# Start integrating using Euler's method
for i in range(n-1):
    # Set up the acceleration
    # Here you could have defined your own function for this
    a = -x[i]
    # update velocity, time and position using the Euler-Cromer method
    v[i+1] = v[i] + DeltaT*a
    x[i+1] = x[i] + DeltaT*v[i+1]
    t[i+1] = t[i] + DeltaT
!ec


===  Exercise 7 (30pt), Bonus exercise ===

You don't need to do this exercise, but it gives you a bonus score of 30 points. Taylor's section 5.4 and the lecture notes on damped oscillations cover most of the theoretical background.

In this exercise we will add to our program a first derivative of position (the velocity) which is meant to mimick the role of friction.
Our differential equation is now
!bt
\[
m\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}+\beta\frac{dx}{dt}+kx=ma(t)+\beta v(t)+kx(t)=0,
\]
!et

where $k$ is a material specific constant and $\beta$ is a constant
representing the resitance from the plane on which the block slides.
We have thus assumed that friction depends on velocity in a linear
way.

We introduce again the dimensionless time $\tau = t\omega_0$ with
$\omega_0=\sqrt{k/m}$.

* 7a (10pt) Divide by $m$ and show that you can rewrite your equation as two first-order coupled differential equations
!bt
\[
\frac{dv}{d\tau} = -2v(t)\gamma-x(t),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{dx}{d\tau} = v(t).
\]
!et
What are the dimensionalities of these two equations? We have defined $\gamma = \beta/2m$.  


* 7b (20pt)  Add the role of friction to your code from exercise 7 and study the cases where (i) $\gamma < \omega_0$ (underdamping), (ii) $\gamma = omega_0$ ( critical damping) and (iii) $\gamma > omega_0$ (overdamping). Plot your resulting positions as functions of time and discuss the physical meaning of your results.
