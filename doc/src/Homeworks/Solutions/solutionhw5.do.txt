===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o Homeworks are available Wednesday/Thursday the week before the deadline. The deadline is at the Friday lecture.
o How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. 

=== Introduction to homework 5 ===

This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational
exercises are a continuation of the topics from the previous homework set. We keep dealing with simple motion problems and conservation laws; energy, momentum and angular momentum. These conservation laws are central in Physics and understanding them properly lays the foundation for understanding and analyzing more complicated physics problems.
The relevant reading background is
o chapters 3 and 4 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and
o chapters 10-14 of Malthe-Sørenssen.
In both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. Malthe-Sørenssen's text contains also several coding examples you may find useful. 

The numerical homework focuses on another motion problem where you can
use the code you developed in homework 4, almost entirely. Please take
a look at the posted solution (jupyter-notebook) for homework 4. You
need only to change the forces at play. The problem at hand is again a
classic one, a block fastened to a spring moving back and forth along the $x$-axis. It is a simpler problem compared to the previous homework. It allows us however to introduce damping (friction) and study more realistic situations. 



=== Exercise 1 (15 pt), Work-energy theorem and conservation laws ===

This exercise was partly discussed during the lectures. It has not yet been edited in the online notes.
We will study a classical electron which moves in the $x$-direction along a surface. The force from the surface is
!bt
\[
\bm{F}(x)=-F_0\sin{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}\bm{e}_x.
\]
!et
The constant $b$ represents the distance between atoms at the surface of the material, $F_0$ is a constant and $x$ is the position of the electron.

* 1a (2pt) Is this a conservative force? And if so, what does that imply?
This is indeed a conservative force since it depends only on position and its _curl_ is zero. This means that energy is conserved and the integral over the work done by the force is independent of the path taken. 
* 1b (4pt) Use the work-energy theorem to find the velocity $v(x)$. 

Using the work-energy theorem we can find the work $W$ done when moving an electron from a position $x_\
0$ to a final position $x$ through the integral
!bt
\[
W=-\int_{x_0}^x \bm{F}(x')dx' =  \int_{x_0}^x F_0\sin{(\frac{2\pi x'}{b})} dx',
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
W=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right].
\]
!et
Since this is related to the change in kinetic energy we have, with $v_0$ being the initial velocity at a  time $t_0$,
!bt
\[
v  = \pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right]+v_0^2}.
\]
!et
* 1c (4pt) With the above expression for the force, find the potential energy.
The potential energy, due to energy conservation is
!bt
\[
V(x)=V(x_0)+\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2-\frac{1}{2}mv^2,
\]
!et
with $v$ given by the previous answer. 
We can now, in order to find a more explicit expression for the potential energy at a given value $x$, define a zero level value for the potential. The potential is defined , using the work-energy theorem , as
!bt
\[
V(x)=V(x_0)+\int_{x_0}^x (-F(x'))dx',
\]
!et
and if you recall the definition of the indefinite integral, we can rewrite this as
!bt
\[
V(x)=\int (-F(x'))dx'+C,
\]
!et
where $C$ is an undefined constant. The force is defined as the gradient of the potential, and in that case the undefined constant vanishes. The constant does not affect the force we derive from the potential.

We have then
!bt
\[
V(x)=V(x_0)-\int_{x_0}^x \bm{F}(x')dx',
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
V(x)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right]+V(x_0).
\]
!et
We can now define
!bt
\[
\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}=V(x_0),
\]
!et
which gives 
!bt
\[
V(x)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}\right].
\]
!et

* 1d (5pt) Make a plot of the potential energy and discuss the equilibrium points where the force on the electron is zero. Discuss the physical interpretation of stable and unstable equilibrium points. Use energy conservation. 

The following Python code plots the potential
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from math import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Deltax = 0.01
#set up arrays
xinitial = -2.0
xfinal = 2.0 
n = ceil((xfinal-xinitial)/Deltax)
x = np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    x[i] = xinitial+i*Deltax
V = np.zeros(n)
# Setting values for the constants. 
F0 = 1.0; b = 1.0; 
# Defining the potential
V = F0*b/(2*pi)*np.cos(2*pi*x/b)
# Plot position as function of time    
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_ylabel('x')
ax.set_xlabel('V')
ax.plot(x, V)
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
!ec

We have stable equilibrium  points for every minimum of the $\cos$ function and unstable equilibrium points where it has its maximimum values. At the minimum the particle has the lowest potential energy and the largest kinetic energy whereas at the maxima it has the largest potential energy and lowest kinetic energy. 
=== Exsercise 2 (15pt), Rocket, Momentum and mass ===

Taylor exercise 3.11.    This exercise was partly discussed during the lectures, see the notes on "Energy and Momentum etc, see the part on Momentum conservation ":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/energyconserv/html/energyconserv.html". Taylor's chapter 3.2 covers also this example.

* 3.11 a and b

Consider the rocket of mass $M$ moving with velocity $v$. After a
brief instant, the velocity of the rocket is $v+\Delta v$ and the mass
is $M-\Delta M$. Momentum conservation gives


!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
Mv&=&(M-\Delta M)(v+\Delta v)+\Delta M(v-v_e)\\
0&=&-\Delta Mv+M\Delta v+\Delta M(v-v_e),\\
0&=&M\Delta v-\Delta Mv_e.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


In the second step we ignored the term $\Delta M\Delta v$ since we
assume it is small. The last equation gives


!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta v&=&\frac{v_e}{M}\Delta M,\\
\nonumber
\frac{dv}{dt}&=&\frac{v_e}{M}\frac{dM}{dt}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Integrating the expression with lower limits $v_0=0$ and $M_0$, one finds

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
v&=&v_e\int_{M_0}^M \frac{dM'}{M'}\\
v&=&-v_e\ln(M/M_0)\\
&=&-v_e\ln[(M_0-\alpha t)/M_0].
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
We have ignored gravity here. If we add gravity as the external force, we get when integrating an additional terms $-gt$, that is
!bt
\[
v=-v_e\ln[(M_0-\alpha t)/M_0]-gt.
\]
!et

* 3.11c
Inserting numbers $v_e=3000$ m/s, $M_0/M=2$ and $g=9.8$ m/s$^{2}$, we find $v=900$ m/s. With $g=0$ the corresponding number is $2100$ m/s, so gravity reduces the speed acquired in the first two minutes to a little less than half its weight-free value.

* 3.11d

If the thrust $\Delta Mv_e$ is less than the weight $mg$, the rocket will just sit on the ground until it has shed enough mass that the thrust can overcome the weight, definitely not a good design. 


===  Exercise 3 (10pt), More Rockets ===

Taylor exercises 3.13 (5pt) and 3.14 (5pt). This is a continuation of the previous exercise and most of the relevant background material can be found in Taylor chapter 3.2. 

Taking the velocity from the previous exercise and integrating over time we find the height
!bt
\[
y(t) = y(t_0=0)+\int_0^tv(t')dt',
\]
!et
which gives
!bt
\[
y(t) = v_et\ln{M_0}-v_e\int_0^t \ln{M(t')}dt'-\frac{1}{2}gt^2.
\]
!et
To do the integral over time we recall that $M(t')=M_0-\Delta M t'$. We assumed that $\Delta M=k$ is a constant. We obtain then that the integral gives
!bt
\[
\int_0^t \ln{M(t')}dt' = \frac{1}{k}\left(M_0\ln{M_0}-M\ln{M}\right)-t,
\]
!et
where we used that $M_0-M=kt$. We have assumed that mass decreases by a constant $k$ times time $t$.
Inserting into $y(t)$ we obtain then
!bt
\[
y(t) = v_et-\frac{1}{2}gt^2-\frac{mv_e}{k}\ln{(\frac{M_0}{M})}.
\]
!et
Using the numbers from the previous exercise with $t=2$ min we obtain that $y\approx 40$ km.

For exercise 3.14 (5pt) we have the equation of motion which reads $Ma=kv_e-bv$ or
!bt
\[
\frac{Mdv}{kv_e-bv}=dt.
\]
!et
We have that $dM/dt =-k$ (assumed a constant rate for mass change). We can then replace $dt$ by $-dM/k$ and we have
!bt
\[
\frac{kdv}{kv_e-bv}=-\frac{dM}{M}.
\]
!et
Integrating gives
!bt
\[
v = \frac{kv_e}{b}\left[1-(\frac{M}{M_0})^{b/k}\right].
\]
!et

=== Exercise 4 (10pt), Center of mass  ===

Taylor exercise 3.20. Here Taylor's chapter 3.3 can be of use. This relation will turn out to be very useful when we discuss systems of many classical particles.

The definition of the center of mass for $N$ objects can be written as
!bt
\[
M\bm{R}=\sum_{i=1}^Nm_i\bm{r}_i,
\]
!et
where $m_i$ and $\bm{r}_i$ are the masses and positions of object $i$, respectively.

Assume now that we have a collection of $N_1$ objects with masses $m_{1i}$ and positions $\bm{r}_{1i}$
with $i=1,\dots,N_1$ and  a collection of $N_2$ objects with masses $m_{2j}$ and positions $\bm{r}_{2j}$
with $j=1,\dots,N_2$.

The total mass of the two-body system is $M=M_1+M_2=\sum_{i=1}^{N_1}m_{1i}+\sum_{j=1}^{N_2}m_{2j}$. The center of mass position $\bm{R}$ of the whole system satisfies then
!bt
\[
M\bm{R}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_1}m_{1i}\bm{r}_{1i}+\sum_{j=1}^{N_2}m_{2j}\bm{r}_{2j}=M_1\bm{R}_1+M_2\bm{R}_2,
\]
!et
where $\bm{R}_1$ and $\bm{R}_2$ are the the center of mass positions of the two separate bodies and the second equality follows from our rewritten definition of the center of mass applied to each body separately. This is the required result.

===  Exercise 5 (10pt), Sliding Block  and Spring (please not again), Scaling the Equations and getting started with numerical project ===
The relevant material with codes etc is covered by the "Lecture Notes on Oscillations":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/harmonic/html/harmonic.html". Taylor's chapter 5, in particular sections 5.1 amd 5.2. 5.4 is relevant for the bonus exercise.
We start now with our next numerical application with simple rewrites of our equations. The system we will look at is that of a block fastened to a spring (which in turn is tied to a wall).
The force acting on the block from the spring in the $x$-drection only is
!bt
\[
m\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}=F(x) = -k(x-b),
\]
!et
where $k$ is a material specific constant and $b$ is the equilibrium position. The block has mass $m$ and $t$ is time. Define the initial time as $t_0$. We will for simplicity set the equilibrium position to zero, that is $b=0$.

* 5a (3pt) Does this force conserve energy? If so, with given initial position and velocity $x_0$ and $v_0$, respectively, find the expression for energy conservation in terms of the potential and kinetic energies.  

This force depdens only on the position and its _curl_ is also zero. Energy is thus conserved.
Integrating the force gives us a potential energy $1/2kx^2$. With initial conditions for the position $x_0$ and the velocity $v_0$ we have that
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2}kx^2+\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}kx_0^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2.
\]
!et


* 5b (3pt) Define a constant $\omega_0=\sqrt{k/m}$ and show that you can write the acceleration as $a(t) = -\omega_0^2 x(t)$. What is the dimentionality of $\omega_0$? (it is normally called a natural frequency).  

The dimensionality of $\omega_0$ is inverse time. The acceleration is
!bt
\[
a=\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}=\frac{F}{m} = -\frac{k}{m}x=-\omega_0^2x.
\]
!et


* 5c (4pt) Introduce now a dimensionless time $\tau = t\omega_0$. Show that you can rewrite the  equation for the acceleration in terms of two first-order differential equations

Starting with
!bt
\[
a=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=\frac{F}{m} = -\frac{k}{m}x=-\omega_0^2x,
\]
!et
and introducing a dimensionless time we have
!bt
\[
\omega_0^2\frac{d^2x}{d\tau^2}=-\omega_0^2x,
\]
!et
and dividing by $\omega_0^2$ we have 
!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x(t)}{d\tau^2}=\frac{dv}{d\tau}=-x.
\]
!et
This gives us our first differential equation
!bt
\[
\frac{dv}{d\tau} = -x,
\]
!et
and using the definition of velocity we have
!bt
\[
\frac{dx}{d\tau} = v.
\]
!et

Both equations (velocity and position) have dimensionality length.
Note that in principle we should have relabeled $v$ as $\overline{v}$ to indicate that it has dimension length and not length divided by time.


===  Exercises 6 and 7  ===

The results are detailed in the lecture notes on oscillations. The text here is simply an iteration of what we have discussed during the lectures.


We consider only the case where the damping force is proportional to
the velocity. This is counter to dragging friction, where the force is
proportional in strength to the normal force and independent of
velocity, and is also inconsistent with wind resistance, where the
magnitude of the drag force is proportional the square of the
velocity. Rolling resistance does seem to be mainly proportional to
the velocity. However, the main motivation for considering damping
forces proportional to the velocity is that the math is more
friendly. This is because the differential equation is linear,
i.e. each term is of order $x$, $\dot{x}$, $\ddot{x}\cdots$, or even
terms with no mention of $x$, and there are no terms such as $x^2$ or
$x\ddot{x}$. The equations of motion for a spring with damping force
$-b\dot{x}$ are

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot{x}+b\dot{x}+kx=0.
\end{equation}
!et

Just to make the solution a bit less messy, we rewrite this equation as

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:dampeddiffyq}
\ddot{x}+2\beta\dot{x}+\omega_0^2x=0,~~~~\beta\equiv b/2m,~\omega_0\equiv\sqrt{k/m}.
\end{equation}
!et

Both $\beta$ and $\omega$ have dimensions of inverse time. To find solutions (see appendix C in the text) you must make an educated guess at the form of the solution. To do this, first realize that the solution will need an arbitrary normalization $A$ because the equation is linear. Secondly, realize that if the form is

!bt
\begin{equation}
x=Ae^{rt}
\end{equation}
!et

that each derivative simply brings out an extra power of $r$. This
means that the $Ae^{rt}$ factors out and one can simply solve for an
equation for $r$. Plugging this form into Eq. (ref{eq:dampeddiffyq}),

!bt
\begin{equation}
r^2+2\beta r+\omega_0^2=0.
\end{equation}
!et

Because this is a quadratic equation there will be two solutions,

!bt
\begin{equation}
r=-\beta\pm\sqrt{\beta^2-\omega_0^2}.
\end{equation}
!et

We refer to the two solutions as $r_1$ and $r_2$ corresponding to the
$+$ and $-$ roots. As expected, there should be two arbitrary
constants involved in the solution,

!bt
\begin{equation}
x=A_1e^{r_1t}+A_2e^{r_2t},
\end{equation}
!et

where the coefficients $A_1$ and $A_2$ are determined by initial
conditions.

The roots listed above, $\sqrt{\omega_0^2-\beta_0^2}$, will be
imaginary if the damping is small and $\beta<\omega_0$. In that case,
$r$ is complex and the factor $e{rt}$ will have some oscillatory
behavior. If the roots are real, there will only be exponentially
decaying solutions. There are three cases:



=== Underdamped: $\beta<\omega_0$ ===

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
x&=&A_1e^{-\beta t}e^{i\omega't}+A_2e^{-\beta t}e^{-i\omega't},~~\omega'\equiv\sqrt{\omega_0^2-\beta^2}\\
\nonumber
&=&(A_1+A_2)e^{-\beta t}\cos\omega't+i(A_1-A_2)e^{-\beta t}\sin\omega't.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Here we have made use of the identity
$e^{i\omega't}=\cos\omega't+i\sin\omega't$. Because the constants are
arbitrary, and because the real and imaginary parts are both solutions
individually, we can simply consider the real part of the solution
alone:

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:homogsolution}
x&=&B_1e^{-\beta t}\cos\omega't+B_2e^{-\beta t}\sin\omega't,\\
\nonumber 
\omega'&\equiv&\sqrt{\omega_0^2-\beta^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

=== Critical dampling: $\beta=\omega_0$ ===

In this case the two terms involving $r_1$ and $r_2$ are identical
because $\omega'=0$. Because we need to arbitrary constants, there
needs to be another solution. This is found by simply guessing, or by
taking the limit of $\omega'\rightarrow 0$ from the underdamped
solution. The solution is then

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:criticallydamped}
x=Ae^{-\beta t}+Bte^{-\beta t}.
\end{equation}
!et

The critically damped solution is interesting because the solution
approaches zero quickly, but does not oscillate. For a problem with
zero initial velocity, the solution never crosses zero. This is a good
choice for designing shock absorbers or swinging doors.

=== Overdamped: $\beta>\omega_0$ ===


!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
x&=&A_1\exp{-(\beta+\sqrt{\beta^2-\omega_0^2})t}+A_2\exp{-(\beta-\sqrt{\beta^2-\omega_0^2})t}
\end{eqnarray}
!et

This solution will also never pass the origin more than once, and then
only if the initial velocity is strong and initially toward zero.




Given $b$, $m$ and $\omega_0$, find $x(t)$ for a particle whose
initial position is $x=0$ and has initial velocity $v_0$ (assuming an
underdamped solution).

The solution is of the form,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
x&=&e^{-\beta t}\left[A_1\cos(\omega' t)+A_2\sin\omega't\right],\\
\dot{x}&=&-\beta x+\omega'e^{-\beta t}\left[-A_1\sin\omega't+A_2\cos\omega't\right].\\
\omega'&\equiv&\sqrt{\omega_0^2-\beta^2},~~~\beta\equiv b/2m.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

From the initial conditions, $A_1=0$ because $x(0)=0$ and $\omega'A_2=v_0$. So 

!bt
\[
x=\frac{v_0}{\omega'}e^{-\beta t}\sin\omega't.
\]
!et



Let us remind ourselves about the differential equation we want to solve (the general case with damping due to friction)
!bt
\[
m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b\frac{dx}{dt}+kx(t) =0.
\]
!et
We divide by $m$ and introduce $\omega_0^2=\sqrt{k/m}$ and obtain
!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac{b}{m}\frac{dx}{dt}+\omega_0^2x(t) =0.
\]
!et

Thereafter we introduce a dimensionless time $\tau = t\omega_0$ (check
that the dimensionality is correct) and rewrite our equation as

!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x}{d\tau^2} + \frac{b}{m\omega_0}\frac{dx}{d\tau}+x(\tau) =0,
\]
!et
which gives us
!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x}{d\tau^2} + \frac{b}{m\omega_0}\frac{dx}{d\tau}+x(\tau) =0.
\]
!et



We then define $\gamma = b/(2m\omega_0)$ and rewrite our equations as
!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x}{d\tau^2} + 2\gamma\frac{dx}{d\tau}+x(\tau) =0.
\]
!et
This is the equation we will code below. The first version employs the Euler-Cromer method.

When setting up the value of $\gamma$ we see that for $\gamma=0$ we get the simple oscillatory motion with no damping.
Choosing $\gamma < 1$ leads to the classical underdamped case with oscillatory motion, but where the motion comes to an end.

Choosing $\gamma =1$ leads to what normally is called critical damping and $\gamma> 1$ leads to critical overdamping.
Try it out and try also to change the initial position and velocity. Setting $\gamma=1$
yields a situation, as discussed above, where the solution approaches quickly zero and does not oscillate. With zero initial velocity it will never cross zero.
