TITLE: PHY321: Classical Mechanics 1
AUTHOR: Homework 4, due Friday February 7
DATE: today

===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o Homeworks are available Wednesday/Thursday the week before the deadline. The deadline is at the Friday lecture.
o How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. 

=== Introduction to homework 4 ===

This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational
exercises deal with simple motion problems and conservation laws; energy, momentum and angular momentum. These conservation laws are central in Physics and understanding them properly lays the foundation for understanding and analyzing more complicated physics problems.
The relevant reading background is
o chapters 3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and
o chapters 10-12 of Malthe-Sørenssen.
In both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. Malthe-Sørenssen's text contains also several coding examples you may find useful. 

The numerical homework focuses on another motion problem where you can
use the code you developed in homework 3, almost entirely. Please take
a look at the posted solution (jupyter-notebook) for homework 3. You
need only to change the forces at play. The problem at hand is a
classic, the gravitational force acting between the sun and the
earth. Here you will notice also that the standard Euler-integration
algorithm is not the best choice and we will introduce the so-called
Euler-Cromer method and the Velocity-Verlet method. These methods will
give much more stable numerical results with only few additions to
your code.

The code you develop here will also be reused when we analyze energy
conservation in homework set 5.

=== Exercise 1 (20 pt),  ===


* 1a (4pt) Find the velocity as a function of time for the electron.
* 1b (4pt)  Find the position as a function of time for the electron.

The field is only acting inside a box of length $L = 2m$.
* 1c (4pt)  How long time is the electron inside the field?
* 1d (4pt)  What is the displacement in the $y$-direction when the electron leaves the box. (We call this the deflection of the electron).
* 1e (4pt)  Find the angle the velocity vector forms with the horizontal axis as the electron leaves the box.


=== Exercise 2 (10 pt), Drag force ===

Taylor exercise 2.3

=== Exercise 3 (10 pt), Falling object  ===

Taylor exercise 2.6

=== Exercise 4 (10 pt), and then a cyclist  ===

Taylor exercise 2.26


=== Exercise 5 (10 pt), back to a falling ball and preparing for the numerical exercise  ===

_Useful material: Malthe-Sørenssen chapter 7.5 and Taylor chapter 2.4._

In this example we study the motion of an object subject to a constant force, a velocity dependent
force, and for the numerical part a position-dependent force.
Without the position dependent force, we can solve the problem analytically. This is what we will do in this exercise.
The position dependent force requires numerical efforts (exercise 7).
In addition to the  falling ball case, we will include the effect of the ball bouncing back from the floor in exercises 7.


Here we limit ourselves to a ball that is thrown from a height $h$
above the ground with an initial velocity
$\bm{v}_0$ at time $t=t_0$.
We assume we have only a gravitational force and a force due to the air resistance.
The position of the ball as function of time is  $\bm{r}(t)$ where $t$ is time.
 The position is measured with respect to a coordinate system with origin at the floor.

We assume we have an initial position $\bm{r}(t_0)=h\bm{e}_y$ and an initial velocity $\bm{v}_0=v_{x,0}\bm{e}_x+v_{y,0}\bm{e}_y$.

In this exercise we assume the system is influenced by the gravitational force
!bt
\[
\bm{G}=-mg\bm{e}_y
\]
!et
and an air resistance given by a square law
!bt
\[
-Dv\bm{v}.
\]
!et

The analytical expressions for velocity and position as functions of
time will be used to compare with the numerical results in exercise 6.

* 5a (3pt) Identify the forces acting on the ball and set up a diagram with the forces acting on the ball. Find the acceleration of the falling ball. 
* 5b (4pt) Integrate the acceleration from an initial time $t_0$ to a final time $t$ and find the velocity.
* 5c (4pt) Find thereafter the position as function of time starting with an initial time $t_0$. Find the time it takes to hit the floor.  Here you will find it convenient to set the initial velocity in the $y$-direction to zero.


We will use the above analytical results in our numerical calculations in exercise 6.




===  Exercise 6 (40pt), Numerical elements, solving exercise 5 numerically and adding the bouncing from the floor ===

_This exercise should be handed in as a jupyter-notebook_ at D2L. Remember to write your name(s). 

Last week we:
o Gained more practice with plotting in Python
o Became familiar with arrays and representing vectors with such objects
 
This week we will:
o Learn and utilize Euler's Method to find the position and the velocity
o Compare analytical and computational solutions 
o Add additional forces to our model
