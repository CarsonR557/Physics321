===== Energy and Energy Conservation =====

Energy conservation is most convenient as a strategy for addressing
problems where time does not appear. For example, a particle goes
from position $x_0$ with speed $v_0$, to position $x_f$; what is its
new speed? However, it can also be applied to problems where time
does appear, such as in solving for the trajectory $x(t)$, or
equivalently $t(x)$. This is the focus of this sub-section.

Energy is conserved in the case where the potential energy, $V(\bm{r})$, depends only on position, and not on time. The force is determined by $V$,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{F}(\bm{r})=-\nabla V(\bm{r}).
\end{equation}
!et

The net energy, $E=V+K$ where $K$ is the kinetic energy, is then conserved,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}(T+U)&=&\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{m}{2}(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2)+V(\bm{r})\right)\\
\nonumber
&=&m\left(v_x\frac{dv_x}{dt}+v_y\frac{dv_y}{dt}+v_z\frac{dv_z}{dt}\right)
+\partial_xU\frac{dx}{dt}+\partial_yU\frac{dy}{dt}+\partial_zU\frac{dz}{dt}\\
\nonumber
&=&v_xF_x+v_yF_y+v_zF_z-F_xv_x-F_yv_y-F_zv_z=0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

The same proof can be written more compactly with vector notation,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{m}{2}v^2+V(\bm{r})\right)
&=&m\bm{v}\cdot\dot{\bm{v}}+\nabla V(\bm{r})\cdot\dot{\bm{r}}\\
\nonumber
&=&\bm{v}\cdot\bm{F}-\bm{F}\cdot\bm{v}=0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Inverting the expression for kinetic energy,
!bt
\begin{equation}
v=\sqrt{2K/m}=\sqrt{2(E-V)/m},
\end{equation}
!et

allows one to solve for the one-dimensional trajectory $x(t)$, by finding $t(x)$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
t=\int_{x_0}^x \frac{dx'}{v(x')}=\int_{x_0}^x\frac{dx'}{\sqrt{2(E-V(x'))/m}}.
\end{equation}
!et

Note this would be much more difficult in higher dimensions, because
you would have to determine which points, $x,y,z$, the particles might
reach in the trajectory, whereas in one dimension you can typically
tell by simply seeing whether the kinetic energy is positive at every
point between the old position and the new position.


Consider a simple harmonic oscillator potential, $V(x)=kx^2/2$, with a particle emitted from $x=0$ with velocity $v_0$. Solve for the trajectory $t(x)$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
t&=&\int_{0}^x \frac{dx'}{\sqrt{2(E-kx^2/2)/m}}\\
\nonumber
&=&\sqrt{m/k}\int_0^x~\frac{dx'}{\sqrt{x_{\rm max}^2-x^{\prime 2}}},~~~x_{\rm max}^2=2E/k.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Here $E=mv_0^2/2$ and $x_{\rm max}$ is defined as the maximum
displacement before the particle turns around. This integral is done
by the substitution $\sin\theta=x/x_{\rm max}$.

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
(k/m)^{1/2}t&=&\sin^{-1}(x/x_{\rm max}),\\
\nonumber
x&=&x_{\rm max}\sin\omega t,~~~\omega=\sqrt{k/m}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

As an example of an integral to solve numerically, consider the following integral. First, rewrite the integral as a sum,

!bt
\begin{equation}
t=\sum_{n=1}^N \Delta x [2(E-V(x_n)/m]^{-1/2}, ~~~
\end{equation}
!et

where $\Delta x=(x-x_0)/N$ and $x_n=x_0+(n-1/2)\Delta x$. Note that
for best accuracy the value of $x_n$ has been placed in the center of
the $n^{\rm th}$ interval. The accuracy will improve for higher values
of $N$, or equivalently, smaller step size $\Delta x$.

Add numerical evaluation of integrals.

===== Conservation of Momentum =====


Newton's third law which met earlier states that _For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction_, is more accurately stated as
_If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction_.

This means that for two bodies $i$ and $j$, if the force on $i$ due to $j$ is called $\bm{F}_{ij}$, then 

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{F}_{ij}=-\bm{F}_{ji}. 
\end{equation}
!et
Newton's second law, $\bm{F}=m\bm{a}$, can be written for a particle $i$ as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{F}_i=\sum_{j\ne i} \bm{F}_{ij}=m_i\bm{a}_i,
\end{equation}
!et

where $\bm{F}_i$ (a single subscript) denotes the net force acting on $i$. Because the mass of $i$ is fixed, one can see that

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{F}_i=\frac{d}{dt}m_i\bm{v}_i=\sum_{j\ne i}\bm{F}_{ij}.
\end{equation}
!et

Now, one can sum over all the particles and obtain

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}\sum_i m_iv_i&=&\sum_{ij, i\ne j}\bm{F}_{ij}\\
\nonumber
&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

The last step made use of the fact that for every term $ij$, there is
an equivalent term $ji$ with opposite force. Because the momentum is
defined as $m\bm{v}$, for a system of particles,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\sum_im_i\bm{v}_i=0,~~{\rm for~isolated~particles}.
\end{equation}
!et

By "isolated" one means that the only force acting on any particle $i$
are those originating from other particles in the sum, i.e. ``no
external'' forces. Thus, Newton's third law leads to the conservation
of total momentum,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\bm{P}&=&\sum_i m_i\bm{v}_i,\\
\nonumber
\frac{d}{dt}\bm{P}&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Consider the rocket of mass $M$ moving with velocity $v$. After a
brief instant, the velocity of the rocket is $v+\Delta v$ and the mass
is $M-\Delta M$. Momentum conservation gives


!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
Mv&=&(M-\Delta M)(v+\Delta v)+\Delta M(v-v_e)\\
0&=&-\Delta Mv+M\Delta v+\Delta M(v-v_e),\\
0&=&M\Delta v-\Delta Mv_e.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

In the second step we ignored the term $\Delta M\Delta v$ because it is doubly small. The last equation gives

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta v&=&\frac{v_e}{M}\Delta M,\\
\nonumber
\frac{dv}{dt}&=&\frac{v_e}{M}\frac{dM}{dt}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Integrating the expression with lower limits $v_0=0$ and $M_0$, one finds

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
v&=&v_e\int_{M_0}^M \frac{dM'}{M'}\\
v&=&-v_e\ln(M/M_0)\\
&=&-v_e\ln[(M_0-\alpha t)/M_0].
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Because the total momentum of an isolated system is constant, one can
also quickly see that the center of mass of an isolated system is also
constant. The center of mass is the average position of a set of
masses weighted by the mass,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_im_ix_i}{\sum_i m_i}.
\end{equation}
!et

The rate of change of $\bar{x}$ is

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\bar{x}}&=&\frac{1}{M}\sum_i m_i\dot{x}_i=\frac{1}{M}P_x.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Thus if the total momentum is constant the center of mass moves at a
constant velocity, and if the total momentum is zero the center of
mass is fixed.

===== Conservation of Angular Momentum =====


Consider a case where the force always points radially,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{F}(\bm{r})=F(r)\hat{r},
\end{equation}
!et

where $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector pointing outward from the origin. The angular momentum is defined as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{L}=\bm{r}\times\bm{p}=m\bm{r}\times\bm{v}.
\end{equation}
!et

The rate of change of the angular momentum is

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\bm{L}}{dt}&=&m\bm{v}\times\bm{v}+m\bm{r}\times\dot{\bm{v}}\\
\nonumber
&=&m\bm{v}\times\bm{v}+\bm{r}\times{\bm{F}}=0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et


The first term is zero because $\bm{v}$ is parallel to itself, and the
second term is zero because $\bm{F}$ is parallel to $\bm{r}$.

As an aside, one can see from the Levi-Civita symbol that the cross
product of a vector with itself is zero. Here, we consider a vector

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\bm{V}&=&\bm{A}\times\bm{A},\\
\nonumber
V_i&=&(\bm{A}\times\bm{A})_i=\sum_{jk}\epsilon_{ijk}A_jA_k.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

For any term $i$, there are two contributions. For example, for $i$
denoting the $x$ direction, either $j$ denotes the $y$ direction and
$k$ denotes the $z$ direction, or vice versa, so

!bt
\begin{equation}
V_1=\epsilon_{123}A_2A_3+\epsilon_{132}A_3A_2.
\end{equation}
!et

This is zero by the antisymmetry of $\epsilon$ under permutations.

If the force is not radial, $\bm{r}\times\bm{F}\ne 0$ as above, and angular momentum is no longer conserved,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\bm{L}}{dt}=\bm{r}\times\bm{F}\equiv\bm{\tau},
\end{equation}
!et

where $\bm{\tau}$ is the torque.

For a system of isolated particles, one can write


!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}\sum_i\bm{L}_i&=&\sum_{i\ne j}\bm{r}_i\times \bm{F}_{ij}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\ne j} \bm{r}_i\times \bm{F}_{ij}+\bm{r}_j\times\bm{F}_{ji}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\ne j} (\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j)\times\bm{F}_{ij}=0,
\end{eqnarray}
!et

where the last step used Newton's third law,
$\bm{F}_{ij}=-\bm{F}_{ji}$. If the forces between the particles are
radial, i.e. $\bm{F}_{ij} ~||~ (\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j)$, then each term in
the sum is zero and the net angular momentum is fixed. Otherwise, you
could imagine an isolated system that would start spinning
spontaneously.

One can write the torque about a given axis, which we will denote as $\hat{z}$, in polar coordinates, where

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
x&=&r\sin\theta\cos\phi,~~y=r\sin\theta\cos\phi,~~z=r\cos\theta,
\end{eqnarray}
!et
to find the $z$ component of the torque,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_z&=&xF_y-yF_x\\
\nonumber
&=&-r\sin\theta\left\{\cos\phi \partial_y-\sin\phi \partial_x\right\}V(x,y,z).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

One can use the chain rule to write the partial derivative w.r.t. $\phi$ (keeping $r$ and $\theta$ fixed),

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_\phi&=&\frac{\partial x}{\partial\phi}\partial_x+\frac{\partial_y}{\partial\phi}\partial_y
+\frac{\partial z}{\partial\phi}\partial_z\\
\nonumber
&=&-r\sin\theta\sin\phi\partial_x+\sin\theta\cos\phi\partial_y.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Combining the two equations,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_z&=&-\partial_\phi V(r,\theta,\phi).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Thus, if the potential is independent of the azimuthal angle $\phi$,
there is no torque about the $z$ axis and $L_z$ is conserved.


!split
===== Symmetries and Conservation Laws =====

When we derived the conservation of energy, we assumed that the
potential depended only on position, not on time. If it depended
explicitly on time, one can quickly see that the energy would have
changed at a rate $\partial_tV(x,y,z,t)$. Note that if there is no
explicit dependence on time, i.e. $V(x,y,z)$, the potential energy can
depend on time through the variations of $x,y,z$ with time. However,
that variation does not lead to energy non-conservation. Further, we
just saw that if a potential does not depend on the azimuthal angle
about some axis, $\phi$, that the angular momentum about that axis is
conserved.

Now, we relate momentum conservation to translational
invariance. Considering a system of particles with positions,
$\bm{r}_i$, if one changed the coordinate system by a translation by a
differential distance $\bm{\epsilon}$, the net potential would change
by

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta V(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2\cdots)&=&\sum_i \bm{\epsilon}\cdot\nabla_i V(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2,\cdots)\\
\nonumber
&=&-\sum_i \bm{\epsilon}\cdot\bm{F}_i\\
\nonumber
&=&-\frac{d}{dt}\sum_i \bm{\epsilon}\cdot\bm{p}_i.
\end{eqnarray}
!et


Thus, if the potential is unchanged by a translation of the coordinate
system, the total momentum is conserved. If the potential is
translationally invariant in a given direction, defined by a unit
vector, $\hat{\epsilon}$ in the $\bm{\epsilon}$ direction, one can see
that

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\epsilon}\cdot\nabla_i V(\bm{r}_i)&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

The component of the total momentum along that axis is conserved. This
is rather obvious for a single particle. If $V(\bm{r})$ does not
depend on some coordinate $x$, then the force in the $x$ direction is
$F_x=-\partial_xV=0$, and momentum along the $x$ direction is
constant.

We showed how the total momentum of an isolated system of particle was conserved, even if the particles feel internal forces in all directions. In that case the potential energy could be written 

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
V=\sum_{i,j\le i}V_{ij}(\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

In this case, a translation leads to $\bm{r}_i\rightarrow
\bm{r}_i+\bm{\epsilon}$, with the translation equally affecting the
coordinates of each particle. Because the potential depends only on
the relative coordinates, $\delta V$ is manifestly zero. If one were
to go through the exercise of calculating $\delta V$ for small
$\bm{\epsilon}$, one would find that the term
$\nabla_i V(\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j)$ would be canceled by the term
$\nabla_jV(\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j)$.

The relation between symmetries of the potential and conserved
quantities (also called constants of motion) is one of the most
profound concepts one should gain from this course. It plays a
critical role in all fields of physics. This is especially true in
quantum mechanics, where a quantity $A$ is conserved if its operator
commutes with the Hamiltonian. For example if the momentum operator
$-i\hbar\partial_x$ commutes with the Hamiltonian, momentum is
conserved, and clearly this operator commutes if the Hamiltonian
(which represents the total energy, not just the potential) does not
depend on $x$. Also in quantum mechanics the angular momentum operator
is $L_z=-i\hbar\partial_\phi$. In fact, if the potential is unchanged
by rotations about some axis, angular momentum about that axis is
conserved. We return to this concept, from a more formal perspective,
later in the course when Lagrangian mechanics is presented.


Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving according to the potential
!bt
\[
V(x,y,z)=A\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2+z^2}{2a^2}\right\}.
\]
!et

Of the quantities, $E,p_x,p_y,p_z,L_x,L_y,L_z$ are conserved?

Solution:
One has both rotational and translational invariance about the $y$ axis, so $L_y$ and $p_y$ are conserved. Because the potential does not depend explicitly on time, energy is also conserved.
