===== Introduction =====

The calculus of variations involves 
problems where the quantity to be minimized or maximized is an integral. 

In the general case we have an integral of the type
!bt
\[ 
E[\Phi]= \int_a^b f(\Phi(x),\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x},x)dx,
\]
!et
where $E$ is the quantity which is sought minimized or maximized.
The problem is that although $f$ is a function of the variables $\Phi$, $\partial \Phi/\partial x$ and $x$, the exact dependence of
$\Phi$ on $x$ is not known.  This means again that even though the integral has fixed limits $a$ and $b$, the path of integration is
not known. In our case the unknown quantities are the single-particle wave functions and we wish to choose an integration path which makes
the functional $E[\Phi]$ stationary. This means that we want to find minima, or maxima or saddle points. In physics we search normally for minima.
Our task is therefore to find the minimum of $E[\Phi]$ so that its variation $\delta E$ is zero  subject to specific
constraints. In our case the constraints appear as the integral which expresses the orthogonality of the  single-particle wave functions.
The constraints can be treated via the technique of Lagrangian multipliers
