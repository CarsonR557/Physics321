===== Introduction =====

Classical mechanics is a topic which has been taught intensively over
several centuries. It is, with its many variants and ways of
presenting the educational material, normally the first _real_ physics
course many of us meet and it lays the foundation for further physics
studies. Many of the equations and ways of reasoning about the
underlying laws of motion and pertinent forces, shape our approaches and understanding
of the scientific method and discourse, as well as the way we develop our insights
and deeper understanding about physical systems.  

There is a wealth of
well-tested (from both a physics point of view and a pedagogical
standpoint) exercises and problems which can be solved
analytically. However, many of these problems represent idealized and
less realistic situations.  The large majority of these problems are
solved by paper and pencil and are traditionally aimed
at what we normally refer to as continuous models from which we may find an analytical solution.  As a consequence,
when teaching mechanics, it implies that we can seldomly venture beyond an idealized case
in order to develop our understandings and insights about the
underlying forces and laws of motion.

!split
===== Numerical Elements =====
On the other hand, numerical algorithms call for approximate discrete
models and much of the development of methods for continuous models
are nowadays being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and
industry, simply because _much larger classes of problems can be addressed_ with discrete models, often  by simpler and more
generic methodologies.

As we will see below, when properly scaling the equations at hand,
discrete models open up for more advanced abstractions and the possibility to
study  real life systems, with the added bonus that we can explore and
deepen our basic understanding of various physical systems

Analytical solutions are as important as before. In addition, such
solutions provide us with invaluable benchmarks and tests for our
discrete models. Such benchmarks, as we will see below, allow us 
to discuss possible sources of errors and their behaviors.  And
finally, since most of our models are based on various algorithms from
numerical mathematics, we have a unique oppotunity to gain a deeper
understanding of the mathematical approaches we are using.



With computing and data science as important elements in essentially
all aspects of a modern society, we could  then try to define Computing as
_solving scientific problems using all possible tools, including
symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical
paper and pencil solutions_. 
Computing provides us with the tools to develope our own understanding of the scientific method by enhancing algorithmic thinking.

!split
=====  Computations and the Scientific Method =====

The way we will teach this course reflects
this definition of computing. The course contains both classical paper
and pencil exercises as well as  computational projects and exercises. The
hope is that this will allow you to explore the physics of systems
governed by the degrees of freedom of classical mechanics at a deeper
level, and that these insights about the scientific method will help
you to develop a better understanding of how the underlying forces and
equations of motion and how they impact a given system. Furthermore, by introducing various numerical methods
via computational projects and exercises, we aim at developing your competences and skills about these topics.


These competences will enable you to

* understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,
* derive, verify, and implement algorithms,
* understand what can go wrong with algorithms,
* use these algorithms to construct reproducible scientific outcomes and to engage in science in ethical ways, and
* think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.

All these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process *per se*.

The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

*However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.*

===== A well-known examples to illustrate many of the above concepts =====

Before we venture into a reminder on Python and mechanics relevant applications, let us briefly outline some of the
abovementioned topics using an example many of you may have seen before in for example CMSE201. 
A simple algorithm for integration is the Trapezoidal rule. 
Integration of a function $f(x)$ by the Trapezoidal Rule is given by following algorithm for an interval $x \in [a,b]$
!bt
\[
  \int_a^b(f(x) dx = \frac{1}{2}\left [f(a)+2f(a+h)+\dots+2f(b-h)+f(b)\right] +O(h^2),
\]
!et
where $h$ is the so-called stepsize defined by the number of integration points $N$ as $h=(b-a)/(n)$.
Python offers an  extremely versatile programming  environment, allowing for
the inclusion of analytical studies in a numerical program. Here we show an
example code with the _trapezoidal rule_. We use also _SymPy_ to evaluate the exact value of the integral and compute the absolute error
with respect to the numerically evaluated one of the integral
$\int_0^1 dx x^2 = 1/3$.
The following code for  the trapezoidal rule allows you  to plot the relative error by comparing with the exact result. By increasing to $10^8$ points one arrives at a region where numerical errors start to accumulate.
!bc pycod
from math import log10
import numpy as np
from sympy import Symbol, integrate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# function for the trapezoidal rule
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s
#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return x*x
# define integration limits
a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
# find result from sympy
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, a, b))
# set up the arrays for plotting the relative error
n = np.zeros(9); y = np.zeros(9);
# find the relative error as function of integration points
for i in range(1, 8, 1):
    npts = 10**i
    result = Trapez(a,b,function,npts)
    RelativeError = abs((exact-result)/exact)
    n[i] = log10(npts); y[i] = log10(RelativeError);
plt.plot(n,y, 'ro')
plt.xlabel('n')
plt.ylabel('Relative error')
plt.show()
!ec


!split
===== Analyzing the above example =====
This example shows the potential of combining numerical algorithms with symbolic calculations, allowing us to 

* Validate and verify  their  algorithms. 
* Including concepts like unit testing, one has the possibility to test and test several or all parts of the code.
* Validation and verification are then included *naturally* and one can develop a better attitude to what is meant with an ethically sound scientific approach.
* The above example allows the student to also test the mathematical error of the algorithm for the trapezoidal rule by changing the number of integration points. The students get _trained from day one to think error analysis_. 
* With a Jupyter notebook you can keep exploring similar examples and turn them in as your own notebooks. 


In this process we can easily bake in
 o   How to structure a code in terms of functions
 o   How to make a module
 o   How to read input data flexibly from the command line
 o   How to create graphical/web user interfaces
 o   How to write unit tests (test functions or doctests)
 o   How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only)
 o   How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments
 o   How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)


The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:
 o New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)
 o Programs are run through convenient user interfaces
 o It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing 
 o Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,
 o Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.

===== Elements of Vector Algebra =====

_Note_: This section is under revision

In these lectures we will use boldfaced lower-case letters to label a vector. A vector $\bm{a}$ in three dimensions is thus defined as
!bt
\[
\bm{a} =(a_x,a_y, a_z),
\]
!et
and using the unit vectors in a cartesian system we have
!bt
\[
\bm{a} = a_x\bm{e}_x+a_y\bm{e}_y+a_z\bm{e}_z,
\]
!et
where the unit vectors have magnitude $\vert\bm{e}_i\vert = 1$ with $i=x,y,z$.

Using the fact that multiplication of reals is distributive we can show that
!bt
\[
\bm{a}(\bm{b}+\bm{c})=\bm{a}\bm{b}+\bm{a}\bm{c},
\]
!et
Similarly we can also show that (using product rule for differentiating reals)
!bt
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(\bm{a}\bm{b})=\bm{a}\frac{d\bm{b}}{dt}+\bm{b}\frac{d\bm{a}}{dt}.
\]
!et

We can repeat these operations for the cross products and show that they are distribuitive
!bt
\[
\bm{a}\times(\bm{b}+\bm{c})=\bm{a}\times\bm{b}+\bm{a}\times\bm{c}.
\]
!et
We have also that
!bt
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(\bm{a}\times\bm{b})=\bm{a}\times\frac{d\bm{b}}{dt}+\bm{b}\times\frac{d\bm{a}}{dt}.
\]
!et
The rotation of a three-dimensional  vector $\bm{a}=(a_x,a_y,a_z)$ in the $xy$ plane around an angle $\phi$ results in a new vector $\bm{b}=(b_x,b_y,b_z)$.  This operation can be expressed in terms of linear algebra as a matrix (the rotation matrix) multiplied with a vector. We can write this as
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \\ b_z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} & 0 \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \\ a_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
We can write this in a more compact form as $\bm{b} = \bm{R}\bm{a}$, where the rotation matrix is defined as
!bt
\[
\bm{R} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} & 0 \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

===== Python practicalities, Software and needed installations =====

We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its
myriad of available libraries.  You will find
Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  

If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel
pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that
you install the following Python packages via _pip_ as 

o pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow 

For Python3, replace _pip_ with _pip3_.

For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to
install _brew_. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional
software via for example 

o brew install python3

For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,
you can use _pip_ as well and simply install Python as 

o sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)

etc etc. 



===== Python installers =====

If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture
into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we
recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up all relevant
dependencies for Python, namely 

* "Anaconda":"https://docs.anaconda.com/", 

which is an open source
distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale
data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that
aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions
are managed by the package management system _conda_. 

* "Enthought canopy":"https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" 

is a Python
distribution for scientific and analytic computing distribution and
analysis environment, available for free and under a commercial
license.

Furthermore, "Google's Colab":"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb" is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!

===== Useful Python libraries =====
Here we list several useful Python libraries we strongly recommend (if you use anaconda many of these are already there)

* "NumPy":"https://www.numpy.org/" is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
* "The pandas":"https://pandas.pydata.org/" library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools 
* "Xarray":"http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/" is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!
* "Scipy":"https://www.scipy.org/" (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
* "Matplotlib":"https://matplotlib.org/" is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
* "Autograd":"https://github.com/HIPS/autograd" can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives
* "SymPy":"https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
* "scikit-learn":"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis
* "TensorFlow":"https://www.tensorflow.org/" is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google
* "Keras":"https://keras.io/" is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano
* And many more such as "pytorch":"https://pytorch.org/",  "Theano":"https://pypi.org/project/Theano/" etc 


Your jupyter notebook can easily be
converted into a nicely rendered _PDF_ file or a Latex file for
further processing. For example, convert to latex as 

!bc 
pycod jupyter nbconvert filename.ipynb --to latex 
!ec

And to add more versatility, the Python package "SymPy":"http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS)  and is entirely written in Python. 



===== Numpy examples and Important Matrix and vector handling packages =====

There are several central software libraries for linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. Several of the more
popular ones have been wrapped into ofter software packages like those from the widely used text _Numerical Recipes_. The original source codes in many of the available packages are often taken from the widely used
software package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages
developed in the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK.  We describe them shortly here.

  * LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems.
  * LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website URL: "http://www.netlib.org" it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available.
  * BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations. Highly parallelized and efficient codes, all available for download from URL: "http://www.netlib.org".


===== Basic Matrix Features =====

!eblock


===== Numpy and arrays =====
"Numpy":"http://www.numpy.org/" provides an easy way to handle arrays in Python. The standard way to import this library is as

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
!ec
Here follows a simple example where we set up an array of ten elements, all determined by random numbers drawn according to the normal distribution,
!bc pycod
n = 10
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
print(x)
!ec
We defined a vector $x$ with $n=10$ elements with its values given by the Normal distribution $N(0,1)$.
Another alternative is to declare a vector as follows
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(x)
!ec
Here we have defined a vector with three elements, with $x_0=1$, $x_1=2$ and $x_2=3$. Note that both Python and C++
start numbering array elements from $0$ and on. This means that a vector with $n$ elements has a sequence of entities $x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1}$. We could also let (recommended) Numpy to compute the logarithms of a specific array as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4, 7, 8]))
print(x)
!ec

In the last example we used Numpy's unary function $np.log$. This function is
highly tuned to compute array elements since the code is vectorized
and does not require looping. We normaly recommend that you use the
Numpy intrinsic functions instead of the corresponding _log_ function
from Python's _math_ module. The looping is done explicitely by the
_np.log_ function. The alternative, and slower way to compute the
logarithms of a vector would be to write

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
from math import log
x = np.array([4, 7, 8])
for i in range(0, len(x)):
    x[i] = log(x[i])
print(x)
!ec
We note that our code is much longer already and we need to import the _log_ function from the _math_ module. 
The attentive reader will also notice that the output is $[1, 1, 2]$. Python interprets automagically our numbers as integers (like the _automatic_ keyword in C++). To change this we could define our array elements to be double precision numbers as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4, 7, 8], dtype = np.float64))
print(x)
!ec
or simply write them as double precision numbers (Python uses 64 bits as default for floating point type variables), that is
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4.0, 7.0, 8.0])
print(x)
!ec
To check the number of bytes (remember that one byte contains eight bits for double precision variables), you can use simple use the _itemsize_ functionality (the array $x$ is actually an object which inherits the functionalities defined in Numpy) as 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4.0, 7.0, 8.0])
print(x.itemsize)
!ec


===== Matrices in Python =====

Having defined vectors, we are now ready to try out matrices. We can
define a $3 \times 3 $ real matrix $\hat{A}$ as (recall that we user
lowercase letters for vectors and uppercase letters for matrices)

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
print(A)
!ec
If we use the _shape_ function we would get $(3, 3)$ as output, that is verifying that our matrix is a $3\times 3$ matrix. We can slice the matrix and print for example the first column (Python organized matrix elements in a row-major order, see below) as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
# print the first column, row-major order and elements start with 0
print(A[:,0]) 
!ec
We can continue this was by printing out other columns or rows. The example here prints out the second column
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
# print the first column, row-major order and elements start with 0
print(A[1,:]) 
!ec 
Numpy contains many other functionalities that allow us to slice, subdivide etc etc arrays. We strongly recommend that you look up the "Numpy website for more details":"http://www.numpy.org/". Useful functions when defining a matrix are the _np.zeros_ function which declares a matrix of a given dimension and sets all elements to zero
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to zero
A = np.zeros( (n, n) )
print(A) 
!ec 
or initializing all elements to 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to one
A = np.ones( (n, n) )
print(A) 
!ec 
or as unitarily distributed random numbers (see the material on random number generators in the statistics part)
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to random numbers with x \in [0, 1]
A = np.random.rand(n, n)
print(A) 
!ec 


===== Meet the Pandas =====


FIGURE: [fig/pandas.jpg, width=600 frac=0.8]

Another useful Python package is
"pandas":"https://pandas.pydata.org/", which is an open source library
providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data
analysis tools for Python. _pandas_ stands for panel data, a term borrowed from econometrics and is an efficient library for data analysis with an emphasis on tabular data.
_pandas_ has two major classes, the _DataFrame_ class with two-dimensional data objects and tabular data organized in columns and the class _Series_ with a focus on one-dimensional data objects. Both classes allow you to index data easily as we will see in the examples below. 
_pandas_ allows you also to perform mathematical operations on the data, spanning from simple reshapings of vectors and matrices to statistical operations. 

The following simple example shows how we can, in an easy way make tables of our data. Here we define a data set which includes names, place of birth and date of birth, and displays the data in an easy to read way. We will see repeated use of _pandas_, in particular in connection with classification of data. 

!bc pycod 
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
data = {'First Name': ["Frodo", "Bilbo", "Aragorn II", "Samwise"],
        'Last Name': ["Baggins", "Baggins","Elessar","Gamgee"],
        'Place of birth': ["Shire", "Shire", "Eriador", "Shire"],
        'Date of Birth T.A.': [2968, 2890, 2931, 2980]
        }
data_pandas = pd.DataFrame(data)
display(data_pandas)
!ec

In the above we have imported _pandas_ with the shorthand _pd_, the latter has become the standard way we import _pandas_. We make then a list of various variables
and reorganize the above lists into a _DataFrame_ and then print out  a neat table with specific column labels as *Name*, *place of birth* and *date of birth*.
Displaying these results, we see that the indices are given by the default numbers from zero to three.
_pandas_ is extremely flexible and we can easily change the above indices by defining a new type of indexing as
!bc pycod
data_pandas = pd.DataFrame(data,index=['Frodo','Bilbo','Aragorn','Sam'])
display(data_pandas)
!ec
Thereafter we display the content of the row which begins with the index _Aragorn_
!bc pycod
display(data_pandas.loc['Aragorn'])
!ec

We can easily append data to this, for example
!bc pycod
new_hobbit = {'First Name': ["Peregrin"],
              'Last Name': ["Took"],
              'Place of birth': ["Shire"],
              'Date of Birth T.A.': [2990]
              }
data_pandas=data_pandas.append(pd.DataFrame(new_hobbit, index=['Pippin']))
display(data_pandas)
!ec


Here are other examples where we use the _DataFrame_ functionality to handle arrays, now with more interesting features for us, namely numbers. We set up a matrix 
of dimensionality $10\times 5$ and compute the mean value and standard deviation of each column. Similarly, we can perform mathematial operations like squaring the matrix elements and many other operations. 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
np.random.seed(100)
# setting up a 10 x 5 matrix
rows = 10
cols = 5
a = np.random.randn(rows,cols)
df = pd.DataFrame(a)
display(df)
print(df.mean())
print(df.std())
display(df**2)
!ec

Thereafter we can select specific columns only and plot final results
!bc pycod
df.columns = ['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth', 'Fifth']
df.index = np.arange(10)

display(df)
print(df['Second'].mean() )
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

from pylab import plt, mpl
plt.style.use('seaborn')
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'

df.cumsum().plot(lw=2.0, figsize=(10,6))
plt.show()


df.plot.bar(figsize=(10,6), rot=15)
plt.show()
!ec
We can produce a $4\times 4$ matrix
!bc pycod
b = np.arange(16).reshape((4,4))
print(b)
df1 = pd.DataFrame(b)
print(df1)
!ec
and many other operations. 

The _Series_ class is another important class included in
_pandas_. You can view it as a specialization of _DataFrame_ but where
we have just a single column of data. It shares many of the same features as _DataFrame. As with _DataFrame_,
most operations are vectorized, achieving thereby a high performance when dealing with computations of arrays, in particular labeled arrays.
As we will see below it leads also to a very concice code close to the mathematical operations we may be interested in.
For multidimensional arrays, we recommend strongly "xarray":"http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/". _xarray_ has much of the same flexibility as _pandas_, but allows for the extension to higher dimensions than two.
