===== Introduction =====


Let us quickly remind ourselves about the definition of a so-called _inertial frame of reference_.
An inertial frame of reference in classical physics (and in special
relativity as well) possesses the property that in this frame of reference a
body with zero net force acting upon it does not accelerate; that is,
such a body is at rest or moving at a constant velocity.  If we recall the definition of Newton's first law, this is essentially its description.

An
inertial frame of reference can be defined in analytical terms as a
frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously,
isotropically, and in a time-independent manner.

Conceptually, the
physics of a system in an inertial frame has no causes external to
the system. An inertial frame of reference may also be called an
inertial reference frame, inertial frame, Galilean reference frame, or
inertial space. 

All inertial frames are in a state of constant, rectilinear motion
with respect to one another; an accelerometer moving with any of them
would detect zero acceleration. Measurements in one inertial frame can
be converted to measurements in another by a simple transformation
(the Galilean transformation in Newtonian physics and the Lorentz
transformation in special relativity).
In general relativity, in any
region small enough for the curvature of spacetime and tidal forces
to be negligible, one can find a set of inertial frames that
approximately describe that region.

In a non-inertial reference frame in classical physics and special
relativity, the physics of a system vary depending on the acceleration
of that frame with respect to an inertial frame, and the usual
physical forces must be supplemented by fictitious forces. In
contrast, systems in general relativity don't have external causes,
because of the principle of geodesic motion.

In classical physics, for example, a ball dropped towards the ground
does not go exactly straight down because the Earth is rotating, which
means the frame of reference of an observer on Earth is not
inertial. The physics must account for the Coriolis effect—in this
case thought of as a force—to predict the horizontal motion. Another
example of such a fictitious force associated with rotating reference
frames is the centrifugal effect, or centrifugal force. We will here,
in addition to the abovementioned example of the Coriolis effect study
a classic case in classical mechanics, namely Focoault's pendulum.


===== Galilean Transformations =====

In many of the examples studied till now we have restricted our
attention to the motion of a particle (or a system of particles) as
seen from an inertial frame of reference. An inertial reference frame
moves at constant velocity with respect to other reference frames. We
can formalize this relationship as a coordinate transformation (known
as a Galilean transformation) between say two given frames, one
labeled $S_0$ and the other one labeled $S$. In our discussions here we will refer to the frame $S_0$ as the reference frame. 

We could consider for example an object in a car, where the car  moves with a
constant velocity with respect to the system $S_0$. We then throw this
object up in the air and study it's motion with respect to the two chosen frames.
We denote the position of this object in the
car relative to the car's frame as $\bm{r}_S(t)$. We have included an explicit 
time dependence here. The position of the car relative to the
reference frame $S_0$ is $\bm{R}(t)$ and the position of the object in
the car relative to $S_0$ is $\bm{r}_{S_0}(t)$.

The following relations between the positions
link the various variables that describe the object in the two frames

!bt
\[
\bm{r}_{S_0}(t) = \bm{r}_{S}(t) + \bm{R}(t).
\]
!et

We will stay with Newtonian mechanics, meaning that we do not consider
relatistic effects. This means also that the time we measure in $S_0$
is the same as the time we measure in $S$. This approximation is
reasonable as long as the two frames do not move very fast relative to
each other. 

We can then compute the time derivatives and obtain the corresponding velocities

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}(t) = \bm{v}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{r}}_{S} + \dot{\bm{R}},
\]
!et

or

!bt
\[
\bm{v}_{S_0}=\bm{v}_{S} + \bm{u},
\]
!et

with $\bm{u}=\dot{\bm{R}}$. 

If our system $S$ moves at constant velocity, we have that the accelerations in the two systems equal each other since $\ddot{\bm{R}}=0$ and we have 

!bt
\[
\bm{a}_{S_0}=\bm{a}_{S}.
\]
!et

The above equations are examples of what we call a homogeneous Galilean transformation.
In an inertial frame, an object  moves with constant velocity (i.e.,
has zero acceleration) if there are no forces acting on it. When we
are not in an inertial frame, there will be spurious (or fictitious)
accelerations arising from the acceleration of the reference
frame. These effects can be seen in simple every-day situations such
as sitting in a vehicle that is accelerating or rounding a corner. Or
think of yourself sitting in a seat of an aircraft that accelerates
rapidly during takeoff. You feel a force which pushes you back in the
seat. Similarly, if you stand in a bus which suddenly brakes (negative
acceleration), you feel a force which may make you fall forward unless
you hold yourself.
In these situations, loose objects will appear to accelerate relative
to the observer or vehicle.


Our next step is thus to study an accelerating frame. Thereafter we
will study reference frames that are rotating. This will introduce
forces like the Coriolis force and the well-known centrifugal
force. We will use these to study again an object which falls towards
the Earth (the Earth rotates around its axis). This will lead to a
correction to the object's acceleration twoards the Earth.

Finally, we bring together acceleration and rotation and end the
discussion here with a classic in classical mechanics, namely
Focault's pendulum.


===== Accelerating Frames (No Rotation) =====

We consider first the effect of uniformly accelerating reference
frames.  We will hereafter label this frame with a subscript
$S$. Assume now that this reference systems accelerates with an
acceleration $\bm{a}_{S_0}$ relative to an inertial reference frame,
which we will label with a subscript $S_0$.  The accelerating frame
has a velocity $\bm{v}_{S_0}$ with respect to the inertial frame.

The figure here (to be added) shows the relation between the two
frames. The position of an object in frame $S$ relative to $S_0$ is
labeled as $\bm{r}_{S_0}$. Seen from this inertial frame, an object in
the accelerating frame obeys Newton's second law

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\frac{d^2\bm{r}_{S_0}}{dt^2}=\bm{F}.
\end{equation}
!et

Here $\bm{F}$ is the net force on an object in the accelerating frame seen from the inertial frame.

If we on the other hand wish to study the motion of this object (say a
ball in an accelerating car) relative to the accelerating frame, we
need to define its position relative to this frame. We label this
position as $\bm{r}_{S}$.

Using the definition of velocity as the time derivative of position
and the standard vector addition of velocities, we can define the
velocity relative to $S_0$ as

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{r}}_{S}+\bm{v}_{S_0}.
\]
!et

The left hand side in the last equation defines the object's velocity
relative to the inertial frame. The right hand side says this is the
object's velocity relative to the accelerating frame plus the velocity
of the accelerating frame with respect to the inertial frame. If we
now take the second derivative of the above equation,
we have the corresponding accelerations

!bt
\[
\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S}+\bm{a}_{S_0}.
\]
!et

Multiplying with the mass of a given object, we can rewrite Newton's
law in the accelerating frame as

!bt
\[
m\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S}=\bm{F}-\bm{a}_{S_0}.
\]
!et

We see that we have again Newton's second law except that we added a
correction which defines an effective acceleration compared to the
equation seen in the inertial frame. We can thus continue to use
Newton's law in the accelerating frame provided we correct the
equation of motion with what is often called a fictitious force. This
often also called an inertial force or an effective force.

_Add example about pendulum in train car_

===== Rotating Frames =====


If you are on Earth's surface and if your reference frame is fixed
with the surface, this is an example of an accelerating frame, where
the acceleration, as we will show below,  is $\Omega^2 r$, where
$r\equiv\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, and $\Omega$ is the angular velocity
of Earth's rotation. The acceleration is inward toward the axis of
rotation, so the additional contribution to the apparent acceleration
of gravity is outward in the $x-y$ plane. In contrast the usual
acceleration $\bm{g}$ is radially inward pointing toward the origin.

We will now deal with motion in a rotating fram and relate this to an
inertial frame. The outcome of our derivations will be effective
forces (or inertial forces) like the abovementioned acceleration (from the centrifugal force) and
the Coriolis force term.

For a reference frame that rotates with respect to an inertial frame,
_Euler's theorem_ is central here. It states that the most general
displacement (motion) of a rigid body with a one point fixed (we
normally approximate a rigid body with a mass center) is a rotation
about some fixed axis. In different words, the most general motion of
any body relative to a fixed point $O$ is a rotation abotu some axis
through the same point $O$. This means that for a specific rotation
about a given point $O$ we only to specify the direction of the axis
about which the rotation occurs with the corresponding angle of
rotation. As we will see below, the direction of the angle of rotation
can be specified by a unit vector $\bm{e}$ in the rotating frame and
the rate of rotation per unit time. The latter defines the angular
velocity $\Omega$. We will define these quantities more rigorously below.
At the end of this section we will also prove Euler's theorem.

What we will show here is that Newton's laws for an object in the rotating frame is given by

!bt
\[
m\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S}=\bm{F}+m\bm{r}\times\dot{\bm{\Omega}}+2m\bm{v}_S\times\bm{\Omega}+m\left(\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}\right)\times\bm{\Omega}.
\]
!et

The first term to the right is the force we defined in the inertial
system, that is $m\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\bm{F}$. The second term is the
angular acceleration of the rotating reference frame, a quantity which
in many cases is set to zero since we assume that the angular velocity
is constant as function of time. The third terms is the Coriolis force, that
is

!bt
\[
\bm{F}_{\mathrm{Coriolis}}=2m\bm{v}_S\times\bm{\Omega},
\]
!et
while the last term is going to give us the standard centrifugal force

!bt
\[
\bm{F}_{\mathrm{Centrifugal}}=m\left(\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}\right)\times\bm{\Omega}.
\]
!et


Let us derive these terms, following much of the same procedure as we
did for an accelerating reference frame. The figure here (to come)
shows the two reference systems $S$ and $S_0$.


We define a general vector $\bm{A}$. It could represent the position,
a given force, the velocity and other quantities of interest for
studies of the equations of motion.

We let this vector to be defined by three orthogonal (we assume motion
in three dimensions) unit vectors $\bm{e}_i$, that is we have


!bt
\[
\bm{A}=A_1\bm{e}_1+A_2\bm{e}_2+A_3\bm{e}_3=\sum_iA_i\bm{e}_i.
\]
!et

These unit vectors are fixed in the rotating frame, that is their time
derivatives are zero. However, for an observer in the inertial frame
$S_0$, however these unit vectors are rotating and may thus have an
explicit time dependence.

Since we want to find an expression for the equations of motion in the
inertial frame and the rotating frame, we need expressions for the
time derivative of a vector $\bm{A}$ in these two frames. Since the
unit vectors are assumed to be fixed in $S$, we have

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{A}}_S=\sum_i\frac{dA_i}{dt}\bm{e}_i=\sum_i\dot{dA_i}\bm{e}_i.
\]
!et

In the inertial frame $S_0$ we have

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{A}}_{S_0}=\sum_i\dot{dA_i}\bm{e}_i+\sum_i A_i\left(\dot{\bm{e}}_i\right)_{S_0}.
\]
!et

We will show below that

!bt
\[
\left(\dot{\bm{e}}_i\right)_{S_0}=\Omega\times\bm{e}_i,
\]
!et

where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity (to be derived below).  This
means we can write the derivative of an arbitrary vector $\bm{A}$ in
the inertial frame $S_0$ as (the vector is defined in the rotating
frame),

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{A}}_{S_0}=\sum_i\dot{dA_i}\bm{e}_i+\sum_i A_i\left(\dot{\bm{e}}_i\right)_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{A}}_S+\sum_i A_i(\Omega\times\bm{e}_i)=\dot{\bm{A}}_S+\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{A}. 
\]
!et

This is a very useful relation which relates the derivative of any
vector $\bm{A}$ measured in the inertial frame $S_0$ to the
correspoding derivative in a rotating frame $S$.

If we now let $\bm{A}$ be the position and the velocity vectors, we
can derive the equations of motion in the rotating frame in terms of
the same equations of motion in the inertial frame $S_0$.

Let us start with the position $\bm{r}$. 

We have
!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{r}}_S+\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}. 
\]
!et

If we define the velocities in the two  frames as 
!bt
\[
\bm{v}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{r}}_{S_0},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{v}_{S}=\dot{\bm{r}}_{S},
\]
!et
we have then

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\bm{v}_{S_0}=\bm{v}_{S}+\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}. 
\]
!et

In order to find the equations of motion, we need the acceleration and
thereby the time derivative of the last equation. The derivative of
the angular velocity $\Omega$ will turn in handy in these derivations
(repeated applications of the chain rule again).
The latter derivative is

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{\Omega}}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{\Omega}}_S+\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{\Omega}, 
\]
!et

which leads to (an expected result, why?) 

!bt
\[
\dot{\bm{\Omega}}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{\Omega}}_S,
\]
!et

since $\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{\Omega}=0$. 

Let us now take the second derivative with respect to time.

Using
!bt
\[
\[\frac{d^2\bm{r}}{dt^2}\]_{S_0}=\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\[\frac{d}{dt}\]_{S_0}\[\frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}\]_{S_0},
\]
!et

we have

!bt
\[
\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\[\frac{d}{dt}\]_{S_0}\[\bm{v}_{S}+\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}\]= \[\frac{d}{dt}\]_{S_0}\bm{v}_{S_0},
\]
!et

which gives 

!bt
\[
\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\[\frac{d\bm{v}_S}{dt}\]_{S}+\dot{\bm{\Omega}}\times \bm{r}+2\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{v}_S+\bm{\Omega}\times(\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}).
\]
!et

Defining the accelerations $\bm{a}_{S_0}=\ddot{\bm{r}}_{S_0}=\dot{\bm{v}}_{S_0}$ and $\bm{a}_{S}=\dot{\bm{v}}_{S}$, we have

!bt
\[
\bm{a}_{S_0}=\bm{a}_{S}+\dot{\bm{\Omega}}\times \bm{r}+2\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{v}_S+\bm{\Omega}\times(\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}).
\]
!et

If we now use Newton's law in the inertial frame $\bm{F}=m\bm{a}_{S_0}$, we get the effective force in the rotating frame (multiplying by the mass $m$)

!bt
\[
\bm{a}_{S}=\bm{F}+m\dot{\bm{r}\times\bm{\Omega}}+2\bm{v}_S\times\bm{\Omega}+m(\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r})\times\bm{\Omega},
\]
!et
which is what we wanted to demostrate. We have the Coriolis force
!bt
\[
\bm{F}_{\mathrm{Coriolis}}=2m\bm{v}_S\times\bm{\Omega},
\]
!et
while the last term is the standard centrifugal force

!bt
\[
\bm{F}_{\mathrm{Centrifugal}}=m\left(\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{r}\right)\times\bm{\Omega}.
\]
!et

In our discussions below we will assume that the angular acceleration of the rotating frame is zero and focus only on the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force.



=== Effective potential and Centrifugal force ===

Suppose we can ignore the Coriolis force. If we focus only on the centrifugal force we have an additional force



In the rotating coordinate system (not an inertial frame), motion is
determined by the apparent force and one can define effective
potentials. In addition to the normal gravitational potential energy,
there is a contribution to the effective potential,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\delta U_{\rm eff}=-\frac{m}{2}\omega^2r_\perp^2=-\frac{m}{2}r^2\omega^2\sin^2\theta,
\end{equation}
!et

where $\theta$ is the polar angle, measured from the north pole. If the true gravitational force can be considered as originating from a point in Earth's center, the net effective potential for a mass $m$ near Earth's surface could be 

!bt
\begin{equation}
U_{\rm eff}=mgh-m\frac{1}{2}\omega^2(R+h)^2\sin^2\theta.
\end{equation}
!et


As an example, let us ask ourselves how much wider is Earth at the
equator than the north-south distance between the poles assuming that
the gravitational field above the surface can be approximated by that
of a point mass at Earth's center.


The surface of the ocean must be at constant effective potential for a
sample mass $m$. This means that if $h$ now refers to the height of
the water

!bt
\[
m g[h(\theta=\pi/2)-h(\theta=0)]=\frac{m}{2}\omega^2(R+h)^2.
\]
!et

Because $R>>h$, one can approximate $R+h\rightarrow R$ on the right-hand side, thus

!bt
\[
h(\theta=\pi)-h(\theta=0)=\frac{\omega^2R^2}{2g}.
\]
!et

This come out a bit less than 11 km, or a difference of near 22 km for
the diameter of the Earth in the equatorial plane compared to a
diameter between the poles. In reality, the difference is
approximately 41 km. The discrepancy comes from the assumption that
the true gravitational force can be treated as if it came from a point
at Earth's center. This would be true if the distribution of mass was
radially symmetric. However, Earth's center is molten and the rotation
distorts the mass distribution. Remarkably this effect nearly doubles
the elliptic distortion of Earth's shape. Due to this distortion, the
top of Mount Everest is not the furthest point from the center of the
Earth. That belongs to the top of a volcano, Chimborazo, in Equador,
which is one degree in latitude below the Equator. Chimborazo is about
8500 ft lower than Everest when measured relative to sea level, but is
7700 feet further from the center of the Earth.





===== Coriolis Force =====

Consider some vector $\bm{A}$ according to an observer in a frame
rotating about the $z$ axis with angular velocity
$\bm{\omega}=\omega\hat{z}$. To an observer in the laboratory frame
(the primed frame) the vector will change even if the vector appears
fixed to the rotating observer. For a rotation of
$\Delta\theta=\omega\Delta t$, the change of the vector due to the
rotation is

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\bm{A}'=\bm{\omega}\times\bm{A}\Delta t.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

If one includes the fact that $A$, the vector measured in the rotating
frame, might be changing as a function of time,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\bm{A}'&=&\Delta\bm{A}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{A}\Delta t,\\
\nonumber
\frac{d}{dt}\bm{A}'&=&\frac{d}{dt}\bm{A}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{A}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et


If the vector happens to be the position $\bm{r}$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\bm{r}}'&=&\bm{v}'=\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Here, the first term on the r.h.s. corresponds to the vector $\bm{r}$
not being fixed, but changing with time, $\dot{\bm{r}}=\bm{v}$. One
can now use $\bm{v}'=\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r}$ in place of
$\bm{A}$, and see

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\bm{v}}'&=&\frac{d}{dt}(\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r})+\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r})\\
\nonumber
&=&\dot{\bm{v}}+\bm{\omega}\times\dot{\bm{r}}+\bm{\omega}\times\left(\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r}\right)\\
\nonumber
&=&\dot{\bm{v}}+2\bm{\omega}\times\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r}).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Because $\dot{\bm{v}}'$ is $\bm{F}/m$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:FmaRotatingFrame}
\bm{F}&=&m\left\{\bm{a}+2\bm{\omega}\times\bm{v}+\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r})\right\},\\
\nonumber
m\bm{a}&=&\bm{F}-2m\bm{\omega}\times\bm{v}-m\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r}).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

The extra terms on the right behave like additional forces. Like
gravitational forces, they are proportional to the mass, so the mass
cancels for many problems.

The last term, $-m\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r})$,
represents the centrifugal force. Using the vector identity,
$\bm{A}\times(\bm{B}\times\bm{C})=\bm{B}(\bm{A}\cdot{\bm{C}})-\bm{C}(\bm{A}\cdot\bm{B})$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r})=\omega^2\bm{r}+(\omega\cdot\bm{r})\bm{\omega}.
\end{equation}
!et

If $\bm{\omega}$ is in the $z$ direction,

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\bm{\omega}\times(\bm{\omega}\times\bm{r})=\omega^2(x\hat{x}+y\hat{y}).
\end{equation}
!et

The centrifugal force points outward in the $x-y$ plane, and its
magnitude is $m\omega^2r_{\rm\perp}$, where
$r_{\rm\perp}=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.

The second term is Eq. (ref{eq:FmaRotatingFrame}) represents the
Coriolis force. It does not enter problems like the shape of the Earth
above because in that case the water was not moving relative to the
rotating frame. Once an object is moving in a rotating frame, the
particle is no longer being described in a single accelerating frame
because at each point the acceleration is $-\omega^2\bm{r}$.

=== Coriolis and falling Objects ===

A ball is dropped from a height $h=500$m above Minneapolis. Due to the
Coriolis force, it is deflected by an amount $\delta x$ and $\delta
y$. Find the deflection. Ignore the centrifugal terms.

The equations of motion are:

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dv_x}{dt}&=&-2(\omega_yv_z-\omega_zv_y),\\
\frac{dv_y}{dt}&=&-2(\omega_zv_x-\omega_xv_z),\\
\frac{dv_z}{dt}&=&-g-2(\omega_xv_y-\omega_yv_x),\\
\omega_z&=&\omega\cos\theta,~~~\omega_y=\omega\sin\theta,~~~\omega_x=0.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Here the coordinate system is $\hat{x}$ points east, $\hat{y}$ points
north and $\hat{z}$ points upward.

One can now ignore all the Coriolis terms on the right-hand sides
except for those with $v_z$. The other terms will all be doubly
small. One can also throw out terms with $\omega_x$. This gives

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dv_x}{dt}&\approx& -2\omega v_z\sin\theta,\\
\frac{dv_y}{dt}&\approx& 0,\\
\frac{dv_z}{dt}&\approx& -g.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

There will be no significant deflection in the $y$ direction, $\delta
y=0$, but in the $x$ direction one can substitute $v_z=-gt$ above,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_x&\approx&\int_0^t dt'~2\omega gt'\sin\theta=\omega gt^2\sin\theta,\\
\delta x&\approx& \int_0^t dt'~v_x(t')=\frac{g\omega\sin\theta t^3}{3}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

One can find the deflections by using $h=\frac{1}{2}gt^2$, to find the
time, and using the all-knowing internet to see that the latitude of
Minneapolis is $44.6^\circ$ or $\theta=45.4^\circ$.

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
t&=&\sqrt{2h/g}=10.1~{\rm s},\\
\omega&=&\frac{2\pi}{3600\cdot 24~{\rm s}}=7.27\times 10^{-5}~{\rm s}^{-1},\\
\delta x&=&17.4~{\rm cm}~~{\rm(east)}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

===== Accelerating and Rotating Frames =====

We can now bring together an accelerating frame with a rotational frame.

=== The Foucault Pendulum ===

The Foucault Pendulum is simply a regular pendulum moving in both
horizontal directions, and with the Coriolis force included. In this
case,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
m\ddot{\bm{r}}&=&\bm{T}+m\bm{g}-2m\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{v},
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

as the centrifugal force term is absorbed into the definition of
$\bm{g}$. The magnitude of the tension, $\bm{T}$, is considered
constant because we consider only small oscillations. Then $T\approx
mg$, and the components, using $\hat{x},\hat{y}$ to correspond to east
and north respectively, are

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
T_x=-mgx/L,~~~T_y=-mgy/L. 
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

If $\Omega$ is the rotation of the earth, and if $\theta$ is the polar angle, $\pi-$lattitude, 

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ddot{x}&=&-gx/L+2\dot{y}\Omega_z,\\
\ddot{y}&=&-gy/L-2\dot{x}\Omega_z.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Here we have used the fact that the oscillations are sufficiently
small so we can ignore $v_z$. Using $\omega_0\equiv\sqrt{k/m}$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ddot{x}-2\Omega_z\dot{y}+\omega_0^2x&=&0\\
\ddot{y}+2\Omega_z\dot{x}+\omega_0^2y&=&0,
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

where $\Omega_z=|\bm{\Omega}|\cos\theta$, with $\theta$ being the
polar angle (zero at the north pole). The terms linear in time
derivatives are what make life difficult. This will be solved with a
trick. We will incorporate both differential equations into a single
complex equation where the first/second are the real/imaginary parts.

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eta\equiv x+iy,\\
\ddot{\eta}+2i\Omega_z\dot{\eta}+\omega_0^2\eta&=&0. 
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Now, we guess at a form for the solutions, $\eta(t)=e^{-i\alpha t}$,
which turns the differential equation into

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
-\alpha^2+2\Omega_z\alpha+\omega_0^2&=&0,\\
\alpha&=&\Omega_z\pm \sqrt{\Omega_z^2+\omega_0^2},\\
&\approx&\Omega_z\pm \omega_0.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

The solution with two arbitrary constants is then

\begin{eqnarray*}
\eta&=&e^{-i\Omega_zt}\left[C_1e^{i\omega_0t}+C_2e^{-i\omega_0t}\right].
\end{eqnarray*}

Here, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are complex, so they actually represent four
arbitrary numbers. These four numbers should be fixed by the four
initial conditions, i.e. $x(t=0), \dot{x}(t=0), y(t=0)$ and
$\dot{y}(t=0)$. With some lengthy algebra, one can rewrite the
expression as

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
label{eq:precmess}
\eta&=&e^{-i\Omega_zt}\left[A\cos(\omega_0t+\phi_A)+iB\cos(\omega_0t+\phi_B)\right].
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Here, the four coefficients are represented by the two real arbitrary
real amplitudes, $A$ and $B$, and two arbitrary phases, $\phi_A$ and
$\phi_B$. For an initial condition where $y=0$ at $t=0$, one can see
that $B=0$. This then gives

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eta(t)&=&Ae^{-i\Omega_zt}\cos(\omega_0t+\gamma)\\
\nonumber
&=&A\cos\Omega_zt\cos(\omega_0t+\gamma)+iA\sin\Omega_zt\cos(\omega_0t+\gamma).
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Translating into $x$ and $y$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
x&=&A\cos\Omega_zt\cos(\omega_0t+\gamma),\\
\nonumber
y&=&A\sin\Omega_zt\cos(\omega_0t+\gamma).
\end{eqnarray}

Assuming the pendulum's frequency is much higher than Earth's
rotational frequency, $\omega_0>>\Omega_z$, one can see that the plane
of the pendulum simply precesses with angular velocity
$\Omega_z$. This means that in this limit the pendulum oscillates only
in the $x$-direction with frequency many times before the phase
$\Omega_zt$ becomes noticeable. Eventually, when $\Omega_zt=\pi/2$,
the motion is along the $y$-direction. If you were at the north pole,
the motion would switch from the $x$-direction to the $y$ direction
every 6 hours. Away from the north pole, $\Omega_z\ne|\bm{\Omega}|$
and the precession frequency is less.  At the equator it does not
precess at all. If one were to repeat for the solutions where $A=0$
and $B\ne 0$ in Eq. (ref{eq:precmess}), one would look at motions
that started in the $y$-direction, then precessed toward the $-x$
direction. Linear combinations of the two sets of solutions give
pendulum motions that resemble ellipses rather than simple
back-and-forth motion.
