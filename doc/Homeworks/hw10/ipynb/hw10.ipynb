    "### Practicalities about  homeworks and projects\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homeworks are available  the week before the deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  Due to the corona virus and many of you not being on campus, we recommend that you scan your handwritten notes and upload them to D2L. If you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex, you can hand in everything as a single jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. \n",
