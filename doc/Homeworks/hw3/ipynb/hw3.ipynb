    "\n",
    "1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homeworks are available Wednesday/Thursday the week before the deadline. The deadline is at the Friday lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. \n",

    "### Introduction to homework 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational\n",
    "exercises deal with the motion of different objects under the\n",
    "influence of various forces. The relevant reading background is\n",
    "1. chapter 2 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. chapters 5-7 of Malthe-Sørenssen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. Malthe-Sørenssen's text contains also several coding examples you may find useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several pedagogical aims we have in mind with these exercises:\n",
    "1. Get practice in setting up and analyzing a physical problem, finding the forces and the relevant equations to solve;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyze the results and ask yourself whether they make sense or not;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finding analytical solutions to problems if possible and compare these with numerical results. This teaches us also how to understand errors in numerical calculations;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Being able to solve (in mechanics these are the most common types of equations) numerically ordinary differential equations and compare the solutions where possible with analytical solutions;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Getting used to studying physical problems using all possible tools, from paper and pencil to numerical solutions;\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Then analyze the results and ask yourself whether they make sense or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above steps outline important elements of our understanding of the\n",
    "scientific method. Furthermore, there are also explicit coding skills\n",
    "we aim at such as setting up arrays, solving differential equations\n",
    "numerically and plotting your results.  Coding practice is also an\n",
    "important aspect. The more we practice the better we get (hopefully).\n",
    "From a numerical mathematics point of view, we will solve the differential\n",
    "equations using Euler's method (forward Euler).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we will develop can be reused as a basis for coming homeworks. We can\n",
    "also extend the numerical solver we write here to include other methods (later) like\n",
    "the modified Euler method (Euler-Cromer, midpoint Euler) and more\n",
    "advanced methods like the family of Runge-Kutta methods and the Velocity-Verlet method.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this course, we will thus have developed a larger code\n",
    "(or set of codes) which will allow us to study different numerical\n",
    "methods (integration and differential equations) as well as being able\n",
    "to study different physical systems. Combined with analytical skills,\n",
    "the hope is that this can allow us to explore interesting and\n",
    "realistic physics problems. By doing so, the hope is that can lead to\n",
    "deeper insights about the laws of motion which govern a system.\n",
    "\n",
