    "### Exercise 1 (10 pt), math reminder, properties of exponential function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise is meant to remind ourselves about properties of\n",
    "the exponential function and imaginary numbers. This is highly\n",
    "relevant later in this course when we start analyzing oscillatory\n",
    "motion and some some wave mechanics. As physicists we should thus feel comfortable with expressions that\n",
    "include $\\exp{(\\imath\\omega t)}$. Here $t$ could be interpreted as time and $\\omega$ as a frequency and $\\imath$ is the imaginary unit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1a (2pt): Perform Taylor expansions in powers of $\\omega t$ of the functions $\\cos{(\\omega t)}$ and $\\sin{(\\omega t)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1b (2pt): Perform a Taylor expansion of $\\exp{(i\\omega t)}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "* 2a (4pt) One of the many uses of the scalar product is to find the angle between two given vectors. Find the angle between the vectors $\\boldsymbol{a}=(1,2,4)$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=(4,2,1)$ by evaluating their scalar product.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2b (6pt) For a cube with sides of length 1, one vertex at the origin, and sides along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, the vector of the body diagonal from the origin can be written $\\boldsymbol{a}=(1, 1, 1)$ and the vector of the face diagonal in the $xy$ plane from the origin is $\\boldsymbol{b}=(1,1,0)$. Find first the lengths of the body diagonal and the face diagonal. Use then part (2a) to find the angle between the body diagonal and the face diagonal.\n",

    "\n",
    "* 3b (5pt) Show that (using product rule for differentiating reals)  $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{a}\\boldsymbol{b})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{b}}{dt}+\\boldsymbol{b}\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{a}}{dt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4 (10 pt), Algebra of cross products\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4a (5pt) Show that the cross products are distribuitive $\\boldsymbol{a}\\times(\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{c})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{a}times\\boldsymbol{c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4b (5pt) Show that $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{b})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{b}}{dt}+\\boldsymbol{b}\\times\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{a}}{dt}$. Be careful with the order of factors \n",

    "### Exercise 5 (10 pt), Area of triangle and law of sines\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 1.18 in the textbook of Taylor, Classical Mechanics. Part (1.18a) gives 5pt and part (1.18b) gives also 5pt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 6 (10pt), Matrices and rotations in the $xy$ plane\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation of a three-dimensional  vector $\\boldsymbol{a}=(a_x,a_y,a_z)$ in the $xy$ plane around an angle $\\phi$ results in a new vector $\\boldsymbol{b}=(b_x,b_y,b_z)$.  This operation can be expressed in terms of linear algebra as a matrix (the rotation matrix) multiplied with a vector. We can write this as"
