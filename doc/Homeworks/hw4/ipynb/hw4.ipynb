    "\n",
    "1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homeworks are available Wednesday/Thursday the week before the deadline. The deadline is at the Friday lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. \n",

    "This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational\n",
