<h3 id="___sec0">Practicalities about  homeworks and projects </h3>

<ol>
<li> You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. <b>Remember to write your name(s)</b>!</li>
<li> How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L.</li> 
</ol>

<h3 id="___sec1">Introduction to the first midterm project, total score 100 (pt) </h3>

<p>
The relevant reading background is

<ol>
<li> chapters 2-5 of Taylor.</li>
<li> chapters 6-14 of Malthe-S&#248;renssen.</li>
</ol>

In this midterm project we will start with a potential similar to the
one we discussed in exercise 4 in homework 6. There are some elements
of that exercise which are repeated here, similarly, a good fraction
of the codes you have developed for homeworks 4-6 can be used here.
We start with a one-dimensional potential and motion.  Thereafter we
extend this potential model to a two-dimensional model and study the
numerical solution of the corresponding problem.

<h3 id="___sec2">Part 1, Particle in a one-dimensional  potential </h3>

<p>
We consider a particle of mass \( m \) moving in a one-dimensional potential,
$$
V(x)=\frac{V_0}{d^4}\left(x^4-2x^2d^2+d^4\right).
$$

We will assume all other forces on the particle are small in comparison, and neglect them in our model.  The parameters \( V_0 \) and \( d \) are known constants. 

<ol>
<li> (5pt) Plot the potential and find the  equilibrium points (stable and unstable) by requiring that the first derivative of the potential is zero. Make an energy diagram (see for example Malthe-S&#248;renssen chapter 11.3) and mark the equilibrium points on the diagram and characterize their stability. The position of the particle is \( x \).</li> 
<li> (5pt) Choose two different energies that give two distinct types of motions, draw them into the energy diagram, and describe the motion in each case.</li>
<li> (5pt) If the particle  starts at rest at \( x=2d \), what is the velocity of the atom at the point \( x=d \)?</li>
<li> (5pt) If the particle  starts at rest at \( x=d \) with velocity \( v_0 \), how large must \( v_0 \) be for the  particle to reach the point \( x=&#8722;d \)?</li>
<li> (5pt) Use the above potential to set up the total forces acting on the particle.  Find the acceleration acting on the particle. Is this a conservative force? Calculate also the <b>curl</b> of the force  \( \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \boldsymbol{F} \) in order to validate your conclusion.</li> 
<li> (5pt) Are linear momentum and angular momentum conserved?</li> 
<li> g (5pt) Write a numerical algorithm to find the position and velocity of the particle at a time \( t+\Delta t \) given the position and velocity at a time \( t \). Here we aim at the <b>Euler-Cromer and the Velocity Verlet algorithms</b>.</li>   
<li> (10pt) Implement the numerical algorithms in a program to find the position of the particle as function of time from \( t=0 \) to \( t=30 \) s using a mass  \( m=1.0 \) kg, the parameter \( V_0=1 \) J and \( d=0.1 \) m. Make a plot of two distinct positions with initial conditions \( x_0=d \) and \( v_0=0.5 \) m/s, \( x_0=d \) and \( v_0=1.5 \) m/s, and \( x_0=d \) and \( v_0=2.5 \) m/s. Plot also the velocity.  Perform calculations with and without the term \( x^4 \) in the potential. Do you see a difference? Compare and discuss the results obtained with the Velocity Verlet algorithm and the Euler-Cromer algorithm.</li> 
<li> (5pt) Describe the behavior of the particle for the three initial conditions  and sketch the motion in an energy diagram. Is energy conserved in your simulations?</li>
<li> (5pt) Repeat the calculations with the full potential and all three initial conditions but now with a damping force \( -\beta v \). Find the modified acceleration using \( \beta/m=0.1 \). Discuss your results and sketch again the motion in an energy diagram.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="___sec3">Part 2, two dimensions </h3>

<p>
We move then to two dimensions. Our particle/object interacts with a surface potential given by
$$
V(r)=\frac{V_0}{d^4}\left(r^4-2r^2d^2+d^4\right),
$$

where \( r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \) is the distance to the origin.

<ol>
<li> (5pt) Show that the acceleration is now \( \boldsymbol{a}=-\frac{4V_0}{md^4}\left(r^3-rd^2\right)\frac{\boldsymbol{r}}{r} \).</li>
<li> (10pt) Rewrite your program to find the velocity and position of the atom using the new expression for the force \( \boldsymbol{F} \). Use vectorized expressions in your code as you did in homework 4 for the Earth-Sun system. See eventually the code from the <a href="https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/energyconserv/html/energyconserv.html" target="_blank">lectures</a>.  We recommend to revisit the Earth-Sun problem from homework 4 since it has several similarities with the problem here.</li>
<li> (10pt) Plot the motion of a particle starting in \( \boldsymbol{r}_0=(d,0) \) from \( t=0 \) s to \( t=20 \) s for the initial velocities \( \boldsymbol{v}_0=(0,0.5) \) m/s, \( \boldsymbol{v}_0=(0,1) \) m/s, and \( \boldsymbol{v}_0=(0,1.5) \) m/s. The parameters \( d \) and \( V_0 \) are as before.</li>
<li> (10pt) Is energy conserved?</li> 
<li> (10pt) Can you choose initial conditions \( r_0 \) and \( v_0 \) in such a manner that the particle moves in a circular orbit with a constant radius? If so, what initial conditions are those? Plot the motion for these conditions.</li>
</ol>
