\section*{From Ordinary Differential equations to Neural Networks, solving mechanics problems in a new way}

\subsection*{Introduction.}

The aim of this project is to study an oscillation problem using different methods for
solving ordinary differential equations. We will focus on traditional methods as well as
on solving similar equations neural networks.
