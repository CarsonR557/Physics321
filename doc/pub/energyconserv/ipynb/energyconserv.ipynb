    "Energy conservation is most convenient as a strategy for addressing\n",
    "problems where time does not appear. For example, a particle goes\n",
    "from position $x_0$ with speed $v_0$, to position $x_f$; what is its\n",
    "new speed? However, it can also be applied to problems where time\n",
    "does appear, such as in solving for the trajectory $x(t)$, or\n",
    "equivalently $t(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start formulating a strategy for energy conservation, we need to discuss integration methods and the concept of work and how it relates\n",
    "to energy.\n",
