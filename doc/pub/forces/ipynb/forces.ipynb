    "## Newton's Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing a physical system we normally start with distinguishing between the object we are studying (we will label this in more general terms as our **system**) and how this system interacts with the environment (which often means everything else!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our investigations we will thus analyze a specific physics problem in terms of the system and the environment.\n",
    "In doing so we need to identify the forces that act on the system and assume that the\n",
    "forces acting on the system must have a source, an identifiable cause in\n",
    "the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A force acting on for example a falling object must be related to an interaction with something in the environment.\n",
    "This also means that we do not consider internal forces. The latter are forces between\n",
    "one part of the object and another part. In this course we will mainly focus on external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact forces, as evident from the name, are forces that occur at the contact between\n",
    "the system and the environment. Well-known long-range forces are the gravitional force and the electromagnetic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a model for forces acting on an object\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set up the forces which act on an object, the following steps may be useful\n",
    "1. Divide the problem into system and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Draw a closed curve around the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Give names and symbols to all the contact forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identify the long-range forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Make a drawing of the object. Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, starting from where the force is acting. The direction of the vector indicates the\n",
    "\n",
    "(positive) direction of the force. Try to make the length of the arrow indicate the relative magnitude of the forces.\n",
    "1. Draw in the axes of the coordinate system. It is often convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion. When you choose direction of the axis you also choose the positive direction for the axis.\n",
