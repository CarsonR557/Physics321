    "2. How do I(we)  hand in?  Due to the extraordinary situation we are in now, the midterm should be handed in fully via D2L. You can scan your handwritten notes and upload to D2L or you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook.\n",
