# PHY321, Classical Mechanics I, Michigan State University, Spring 2020

_Due to the corona virus, all lectures from March 13 are done remotely via zoom. All videos and handwritten notes are in D2L and below here. The videos are posted immediately after the lecture. Feel free to comment on the material. This is a rather unique situation and your feedback is essential for improving the quality of the teaching material.
Stay well._

## Learning outcomes (more material to come)

After the course you should:

- be able to analyze forces that act on objects, apply Newtonâs laws to determine the equations of motion, and solve these both analytically and numerically,
- be able to describe the rotational motion of rigid bodies using torque, moment of inertia, and angular momentum, and apply Newtonâs second law for rotational motion to solve the equations of motion,
- be able to apply conservation laws for mechanical energy, momentum, and angular momentum to solve static and dynamic problems and to analyze collisions between bodies,
know the definitions that are relevant for elasticity theory,
- be able to apply different strategies to solve specific problems, introduce approximations if necessary, and interpret results and discuss these in a wider context.
